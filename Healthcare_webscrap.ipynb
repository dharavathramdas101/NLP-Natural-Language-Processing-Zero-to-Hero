For other uses, see AIDS (disambiguation)\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),[9][10][11] a retrovirus.[12] Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[4] Typically, this is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms.[5] If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function.[4] These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[5] This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[5]\\n\\nHIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and vaginal sex), contaminated hypodermic needles or blood transfusions, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[13] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus.[14] Oral sex has little to no risk of transmitting the virus.[15] Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, as well as both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.[4] Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication.[4]\\n\\nRecognized worldwide in the early 1980s,[16] HIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination.[17] The disease also has large economic impacts.[17] There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact.[18] The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church\\'s position not to support condom use as prevention.[19] It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.[20]\\n\\nHIV made the jump from other primates to humans in west-central Africa in the early-to-mid 20th century.[21] AIDS was first recognized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.[16] Between the first time AIDS was readily identified through 2021, the disease is estimated to have caused at least 40 million deaths worldwide.[22] In 2021, there were 650,000 deaths and about 38 million people worldwide living with HIV.[8] An estimated 20.6 million of these people live in eastern and southern Africa.[23] HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.[24]\\n\\nThe United States\\' National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Gates Foundation have pledged $200 million focused on developing a global cure for AIDS.[25] While there is no cure or vaccine, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.[5][6] Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.[26] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.[7]\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nThere are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency, and AIDS.[1][27]\\n\\nAcute infection\\n\\nMain symptoms of acute HIV infection\\n\\nThe initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.[27][28] Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms.[29][30] Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.[28][30] The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically.[31] Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage.[28] Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur.[30] Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occur.[30] The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.[30]\\n\\nOwing to their nonspecific character, these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.[30]\\n\\nClinical latency\\n\\nThe initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.[1] Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years[32] to over 20 years[33] (on average, about eight years).[34] While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.[1] Between 50% and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.[27]\\n\\nAlthough most HIV-1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years.[30][35] These individuals are classified as \"HIV controllers\" or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP).[35] Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as \"elite controllers\" or \"elite suppressors\". They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.[36]\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome\\n\\nMain symptoms of AIDS\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection.[30] In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.[30] The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis.[30] Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections.[30]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system.[37] Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person\\'s environment.[30] These infections may affect nearly every organ system.[38]\\n\\nPeople with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31] Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is the most common cancer, occurring in 10% to 20% of people with HIV.[39] The second-most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3% to 4%.[39] Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).[39] Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV).[39] Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.[40]\\n\\nAdditionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and unintended weight loss.[41] Diarrhea is another common symptom, present in about 90% of people with AIDS.[42] They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.[43]\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nAverage per act risk of getting HIV\\n\\nby exposure route to an infected source Exposure route Chance of infection Blood transfusion 90%[44] Childbirth (to child) 25%[45][ clarification needed ] Needle-sharing injection drug use 0.67%[46] Percutaneous needle stick 0.30%[47] Receptive anal intercourse* 0.04–3.0%[48] Insertive anal intercourse* 0.03%[49] Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.05–0.30%[48][50] Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.01–0.38%[48][50] Receptive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.04%[48] Insertive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.005%[51] * assuming no condom use\\n\\n§ source refers to oral intercourse\\n\\nperformed on a man\\n\\nHIV is spread by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission).[13] There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.[52] It is also possible to be co-infected by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.[53]\\n\\nSexual\\n\\nThe most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.[13] However, an HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.[54][55] The existence of functionally noncontagious HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy was controversially publicized in the 2008 Swiss Statement, and has since become accepted as medically sound.[56]\\n\\nGlobally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex;[13] however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2017 , most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (82% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70% of total new diagnoses).[57][58] In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.[59]\\n\\nWith regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.[60] In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.[60] The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4–1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.[60][61] While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present.[62] The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as \"nearly nil\";[63] however, a few cases have been reported.[64] The per-act risk is estimated at 0–0.04% for receptive oral intercourse.[65] In settings involving prostitution in low-income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.[60]\\n\\nRisk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections[66] and genital ulcers.[60] Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold.[60] Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission.[65]\\n\\nThe viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission.[67] During the first 2.5 months of an HIV infection a person\\'s infectiousness is twelve times higher due to the high viral load associated with acute HIV.[65] If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.[60]\\n\\nCommercial sex workers (including those in pornography) have an increased likelihood of contracting HIV.[68][69] Rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission.[70] Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.[71]\\n\\nBody fluids\\n\\nCDC poster from 1989 highlighting the threat of AIDS associated with drug use\\n\\nThe second-most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products.[13] Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle-stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63% and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%.[72] The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.[52] This risk may, however, be up to 5% if the introduced blood was from a person with a high viral load and the cut was deep.[73] In the United States, intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009,[74] and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive.[13]\\n\\nHIV is transmitted in about 90% of blood transfusions using infected blood.[44] In developed countries the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed;[13] for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million[75] and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008.[76] In low-income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008),[77] and it is estimated that up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.[13][78] It is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation, although this is rare because of screening.[79]\\n\\nUnsafe medical injections play a role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12% and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use.[80] The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%.[80] Risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this area of the world.[80]\\n\\nPeople giving or receiving tattoos, piercings, and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented.[81] It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV.[82]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nHIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV.[83][13] As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children.[84] In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20%, and in those who also breastfeed 35%.[84] Treatment decreases this risk to less than 5%.[85]\\n\\nAntiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the baby decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed.[86] If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.[81] If a woman is untreated, two years of breastfeeding results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%.[87] Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either exclusive breastfeeding or the provision of safe formula.[87] All women known to be HIV-positive should be taking lifelong antiretroviral therapy.[87]\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nDiagram of a HIV virion structure\\n\\nHIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.[88]\\n\\nHIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[89] part of the family Retroviridae.[90] Lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics. Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[91] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors.[92] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system.[93] Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.[94]\\n\\nHIV is now known to spread between CD4+ T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.[95] In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.[95] HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.[96][97] The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus\\'s ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.[95][98]\\n\\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more virulent, more infective,[99] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[100]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nHIV/AIDS explained in a simple way\\n\\nHIV replication cycle\\n\\nAfter the virus enters the body, there is a period of rapid viral replication, leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.[101] This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.[102]\\n\\nUltimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4+ T cells. This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.[103] During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.[104]\\n\\nAlthough the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.[105] The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co-receptor to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so.[106] A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.[107]\\n\\nHIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection.[108] A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected.[108] Continuous HIV replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase.[109] Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.[110]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n+ T cell counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection.

Since the WHO\\'s staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow a comparison for statistical purposes.[27][28][115]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.[28] Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.[28] The WHO system uses the following categories:\\n\\nPrimary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome [28]\\n\\nStage I: HIV infection is asymptomatic with a CD4 + T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. [28] May include generalized lymph node enlargement. [28]\\n\\nT cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. May include generalized lymph node enlargement. Stage II: Mild symptoms, which may include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. A CD4 count of less than 500/µl [28]\\n\\nStage III: Advanced symptoms, which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl [28]\\n\\nStage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms, which include toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, or lungs, and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl[28]\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008 and 2014.[115][116] This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups.[116] In those greater than six years of age it is:[116]\\n\\nStage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test.\\n\\nStage 1: CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µl or AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nUnknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications.\\n\\nFor surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4+ T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.[27]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPeople wearing AIDS awareness signs. On the left: \"Facing AIDS a condom and a pill at a time\"; on the right: \"I am Facing AIDS because people I ♥ are infected\"\\n\\nConsistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[117] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[118] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[119] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[120] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[121]\\n\\nCircumcision in sub-Saharan Africa \"reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months\".[122] Owing to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[123] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[124][125] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[126][127][128]\\n\\nPrograms encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[129] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[130] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high-risk behavior.[131][132] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[133] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[134] Enhanced family planning services appear to increase the likelihood of women with HIV using contraception, compared to basic services.[135] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[66]\\n\\nPre-exposure\\n\\nAntiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[136] TASP is associated with a 10- to 20-fold reduction in transmission risk.[136][137] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in people at high risk including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV-positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[120][138] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users, with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[139] The USPSTF, in 2019, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[140]\\n\\nUniversal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[141] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor, and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[142][143]\\n\\nPost-exposure\\n\\nA course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[144] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[144] As of 2013 , the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[145]\\n\\nPEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV-positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[146] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[147] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[52]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nPrograms to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[84][142] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant, and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[84][148] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[149] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[150] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[151]\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nCurrently there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009; it found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[152]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is currently no cure, nor an effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which slows progression of the disease.[153] As of 2010 , more than 6.6 million people were receiving HAART in low- and middle-income countries.[154] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections. As of July 2022 , four people have been successfully cleared of HIV.[155][156][157] Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy within one week of diagnosis appear to improve treatment outcomes in low and medium-income settings.[158]\\n\\nAntiviral therapy\\n\\nStribild – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of emtricitabine, – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of elvitegravir tenofovir and the booster cobicistat\\n\\nCurrent HAART options are combinations (or \"cocktails\") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or \"classes\", of antiretroviral agents.[159] Initially, treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).[160] Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).[160] As of 2019 , dolutegravir/lamivudine/tenofovir is listed by the World Health Organization as the first-line treatment for adults, with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz as an alternative.[161] Combinations of agents that include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.[159]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization and the United States recommend antiretrovirals in people of all ages (including pregnant women) as soon as the diagnosis is made, regardless of CD4 count.[26][162][163] Once treatment is begun, it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or \"holidays\".[31] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[31] The desired outcome of treatment is a long-term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[31] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[31] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[31] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[31]\\n\\nBenefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[164] In the developing world, treatment also improves physical and mental health.[165] With treatment, there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[159] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[159][166] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[31] Reasons for non-adherence to treatment include poor access to medical care,[167] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[168] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may reduce adherence.[169] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[170] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low- and middle-income countries as of 2010 ,[154] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[171]\\n\\nSpecific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[172] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[27] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[172][173] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[174] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[31] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[31]\\n\\nTreatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than five years of age; children above five are treated like adults.[175] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[176]\\n\\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.[177] The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation.[177] This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.[177]\\n\\nThe combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to a certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).[177]\\n\\nCabotegravir combined with rilpivirine (Cabenuva) is a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.[178][179]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections\\n\\nMeasures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[172]\\n\\nAdults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT); the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[180] Children with HIV may benefit from screening for tuberculosis.[181] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however, it may also be given after infection.[182]\\n\\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age, and ceasing breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, is recommended in resource-limited settings.[183] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person\\'s CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[184] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[185] Appropriate preventive measures reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[186] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[187][188]\\n\\nDiet\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[189] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV-positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[189][190][191][192] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections; however, evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[193]\\n\\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are up to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who are not tested positive with the virus.[194]\\n\\nEvidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[195] For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[196] If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[196] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[197]\\n\\nAlternative medicine\\n\\nIn the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[198] whose effectiveness has not been established.[199] There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[200] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[201]\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\n0 1–4 5–12 13–34 35–61 62–134 135–215 216–458 459–1,402 1,403–5,828 Deaths due to HIV/AIDS per million people in 2012:\\n\\nHIV/AIDS has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of the world.[202] Prognosis varies between people, and both the CD4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes.[30] Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[7] After the diagnosis of AIDS, if treatment is not available, survival ranges between 6 and 19 months.[203][204] HAART and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80%, and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20–50 years.[202][205][206] This is between two thirds[205] and nearly that of the general population.[31][207] If treatment is started late in the infection, prognosis is not as good:[31] for example, if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of AIDS, life expectancy is ~10–40 years.[31][202] Half of infants born with HIV die before two years of age without treatment.[183][clarification needed]\\n\\nThe primary causes of death from HIV/AIDS are opportunistic infections and cancer, both of which are frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system.[186][208] Risk of cancer appears to increase once the CD4 count is below 500/μL.[31] The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a person\\'s susceptibility and immune function;[209] their access to health care, the presence of co-infections;[203][210] and the particular strain (or strains) of the virus involved.[211][212]\\n\\nTuberculosis co-infection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with HIV/AIDS being present in a third of all HIV-infected people and causing 25% of HIV-related deaths.[213] HIV is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis.[214] Hepatitis C is another very common co-infection where each disease increases the progression of the other.[215] The two most common cancers associated with HIV/AIDS are Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[208] Other cancers that are more frequent include anal cancer, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31][216]\\n\\nEven with anti-retroviral treatment, over the long term HIV-infected people may experience neurocognitive disorders,[217] osteoporosis,[218] neuropathy,[219] cancers,[220][221] nephropathy,[222] and cardiovascular disease.[173] Some conditions, such as lipodystrophy, may be caused both by HIV and its treatment.[173]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nSee or edit source data. [223] Percentage of people with HIV/AIDS\\n\\n[223] Trends in new cases and deaths per year from HIV/AIDS\\n\\nSome authors consider HIV/AIDS a global pandemic.[224] As of 2016 , approximately 36.7 million people worldwide have HIV, the number of new infections that year being about 1.8 million.[225] This is down from 3.1 million new infections in 2001.[226] Slightly over half the infected population are women and 2.1 million are children.[225] It resulted in about 1 million deaths in 2016, down from a peak of 1.9 million in 2005.[225]\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected. In 2010, an estimated 68% (22.9 million) of all HIV cases and 66% of all deaths (1.2 million) occurred in this region.[227] This means that about 5% of the adult population is infected[228] and it is believed to be the cause of 10% of all deaths in children.[229] Here, in contrast to other regions, women comprise nearly 60% of cases.[227] South Africa has the largest population of people with HIV of any country in the world at 5.9 million.[227] Life expectancy has fallen in the worst-affected countries due to HIV/AIDS; for example, in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana.[24] Mother-to-child transmission in Botswana and South Africa, as of 2013 , has decreased to less than 5%, with improvement in many other African nations due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy.[230]\\n\\nSouth & South East Asia is the second most affected; in 2010 this region contained an estimated 4 million cases or 12% of all people living with HIV resulting in approximately 250,000 deaths.[228] Approximately 2.4 million of these cases are in India.[227]\\n\\nDuring 2008 in the United States approximately 1.2 million people aged ≥13 years were living with HIV, resulting in about 17,500 deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in that year, 236,400 people or 20% of infected Americans were unaware of their infection.[231] As of 2016 about 675,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the US since the beginning of the HIV epidemic.[232] In the United Kingdom as of 2015 , there were approximately 101,200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths.[233] In Canada as of 2008, there were about 65,000 cases causing 53 deaths.[234] Between the first recognition of AIDS (in 1981) and 2009, it has led to nearly 30 million deaths.[235] Rates of HIV are lowest in North Africa and the Middle East (0.1% or less), East Asia (0.1%), and Western and Central Europe (0.2%).[228] The worst-affected European countries, in 2009 and 2012 estimates, are Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Moldova, Portugal and Belarus, in decreasing order of prevalence.[236]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nDiscovery\\n\\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\". Thereported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\".\\n\\nThe first news story on the disease appeared on May 18, 1981, in the gay newspaper New York Native.[237][238] AIDS was first clinically reported on June 5, 1981, with five cases in the United States.[39][239] The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems.[240] Soon thereafter, a large number of homosexual men developed a generally rare skin cancer called Kaposi\\'s sarcoma (KS).[241][242] Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.[243]\\n\\nIn the early days, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of diseases associated with it, such as lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus.[244][245] They also used Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and opportunistic infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981.[246] At one point the CDC referred to it as the \"4H disease\", as the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and Haitians.[247][248] The term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had also been coined.[249] However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community,[246] it was realized that the term GRID was misleading, and the term AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982.[250] By September 1982 the CDC started referring to the disease as AIDS.[251]\\n\\nIn 1983, two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science.[252][245] Gallo claimed a virus which his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) that his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo\\'s group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier\\'s group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo\\'s group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier\\'s group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).[243] As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.[253]\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe origin of HIV / AIDS and the circumstances that led to its emergence remain unsolved.[254]\\n\\nBoth HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century.[21] HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes).[255][256] The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in coastal West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Ivory Coast).[100] New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.[257] HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.[258]\\n\\nThere is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[259] However, SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[260] Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century.\\n\\nSpecific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to c. 1910.[261] Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.[262] While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners has a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had syphilis.[262]\\n\\nAn alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa after World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.[260][263][264]\\n\\nThe earliest well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo.[265] The virus may have been present in the U.S. as early as the mid-to-late 1950s, as a sixteen-year-old male named Robert Rayford presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969. In the 1970s, there were cases of getting parasites and becoming sick with what was called \"gay bowel disease\", but what is now suspected to have been AIDS.[266]\\n\\nThe earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966, that of Arvid Noe.[267] In July 1960, in the wake of Congo\\'s independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium, who did not leave behind an African elite to run the country. By 1962, Haitians made up the second-largest group of well-educated experts (out of the 48 national groups recruited), that totaled around 4500 in the country.[268][269] Dr. Jacques Pépin, a Canadian author of The Origins of AIDS, stipulates that Haiti was one of HIV\\'s entry points to the U.S. and that a Haitian may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s.[269] Although there was known to have been at least one case of AIDS in the U.S. from 1966,[270] the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa (including the U.S.) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and brought the infection to the U.S. at some time around 1969.[254] The epidemic rapidly spread among high-risk groups (initially, sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men). By 1978, the prevalence of HIV-1 among gay male residents of New York City and San Francisco was estimated at 5%, suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected.[254]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nStigma\\n\\nAIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV-infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV-infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the quarantine of HIV-infected individuals.[17] Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.[272]\\n\\nAIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:\\n\\nInstrumental AIDS stigma —a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. [273]\\n\\n—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. Symbolic AIDS stigma —the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. [273]\\n\\n—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. Courtesy AIDS stigma—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV-positive people.[274]\\n\\nOften, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, and intravenous drug use.[275]\\n\\nIn many developed countries, there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality, and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual attitudes.[276] There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.[273] However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.[277] To get a better understanding of the anti-homosexual attitudes around AIDs the musical Rent explores this.[278]\\n\\nIn 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for those diagnosed with AIDS to marry in China.[279]\\n\\nIn 2013, the U.S. National Library of Medicine developed a traveling exhibition titled Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture;[280] this covered medical research, the U.S. government\\'s response, and personal stories from people with AIDS, caregivers, and activists.[281]\\n\\nEconomic impact\\n\\nChanges in life expectancy in some African countries, 1960–2012\\n\\nHIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.[229] The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.[229][282] Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. Before death they will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.[229] Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.[283]\\n\\nReturning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. Unemployment in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with suicidal ideation, memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases self-esteem, sense of dignity, confidence, and quality of life for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low-quality evidence).[284]\\n\\nBy affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS, resulting in increasing pressure on the state\\'s finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay, and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.[283]\\n\\nAt the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d\\'Ivoire showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.[285]\\n\\nReligion and AIDS\\n\\nThe topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.[286][287] The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis, argues that cultural changes are needed, including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.[287]\\n\\nSome religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the Hackney-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to many deaths.[288] The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertised an \"anointing water\" to promote God\\'s healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.[288]\\n\\nMedia portrayal\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American gay actor Rock Hudson. He had been diagnosed during 1984, announced that he had had the virus on July 25, 1985, and died a few months later on October 2, 1985.[289] Another notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden, a gay politician and son of former prime minister Anthony Eden.[290] On November 24, 1991, the virus claimed the life of British rock star Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen, who died from an AIDS-related illness having only revealed the diagnosis on the previous day.[291]\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile heterosexual cases of the virus was American tennis player Arthur Ashe. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive on August 31, 1988, having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s. Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS, but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992.[292] He died as a result on February 6, 1993, aged 49.[293]\\n\\nTherese Frare\\'s photograph of gay activist David Kirby, as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family, was taken in April 1990. Life magazine said the photo became the one image \"most powerfully identified with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\" The photo was displayed in Life, was the winner of the World Press Photo, and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a United Colors of Benetton advertising campaign in 1992.[294]\\n\\nMany famous artists and AIDS activists such as Larry Kramer, Diamanda Galás and Rosa von Praunheim[295] campaign for AIDS education and the rights of those affected. These artists worked with various media formats.\\n\\nCriminal transmission\\n\\nCriminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.[296] Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.\\n\\nIn 1996, Ugandan-born Canadian Johnson Aziga was diagnosed with HIV; he subsequently had unprotected sex with eleven women without disclosing his diagnosis. By 2003, seven had contracted HIV; two died from complications related to AIDS.[297][298] Aziga was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.[299]\\n\\nMisconceptions\\n\\nThere are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. Three misconceptions are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS,[300][301][302] and that HIV can infect only gay men and drug users.[303][304] In 2014, some among the British public wrongly thought one could get HIV from kissing (16%), sharing a glass (5%), spitting (16%), a public toilet seat (4%), and coughing or sneezing (5%).[305] Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection, and that open discussion of HIV and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of AIDS.[306][307]\\n\\nA small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS,[308] the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods.[309][310] These claims, known as AIDS denialism, have been examined and rejected by the scientific community.[311] However, they have had a significant political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government\\'s official embrace of AIDS denialism (1999–2005) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country\\'s AIDS epidemic, and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections.[312][313][314]\\n\\nSeveral discredited conspiracy theories have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. Operation INFEKTION was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed—and continue to believe—in such claims.[315]\\n\\nAt the peak of the HIV/AIDS outbreak, there was also misinformation spread from some governmental institutions. For example, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the AIDS outbreak, stated in the context of a conversation about childhood infections, “if the close contact of a child is a household contact, perhaps there will be a certain number of cases of individuals who are just living with and in close contact with someone with AIDS, or at risk of AIDS, who does not necessarily have to have intimate sexual contact or share a needle, but just the ordinary close contact that one sees in normal interpersonal relations.”[316] This and similar statements made by governmental agencies potentially fueled the unfounded fear that the public had that AIDS could be spread by ordinary close contact rather than through sexual or fluid transmission as is most commonly the case.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nHIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent, and about AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.\\n\\nMany governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[317] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[318][319]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with the Medical Wikipedia app. Wikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with theSpectrum of conditions caused by HIV infection\\n\\n\"AIDS\" and \"Aids\" redirect here.

Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.[30]\\n\\nClinical latency\\n\\nThe initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.[1] Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years[32] to over 20 years[33] (on average, about eight years).[34] While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.[1] Between 50% and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.[27]\\n\\nAlthough most HIV-1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years.[30][35] These individuals are classified as \"HIV controllers\" or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP).[35] Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as \"elite controllers\" or \"elite suppressors\". They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.[36]\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome\\n\\nMain symptoms of AIDS\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection.[30] In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.[30] The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis.[30] Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections.[30]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system.[37] Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person\\'s environment.[30] These infections may affect nearly every organ system.[38]\\n\\nPeople with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31] Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is the most common cancer, occurring in 10% to 20% of people with HIV.[39] The second-most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3% to 4%.[39] Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).[39] Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV).[39] Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.[40]\\n\\nAdditionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and unintended weight loss.[41] Diarrhea is another common symptom, present in about 90% of people with AIDS.[42] They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.[43]\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nAverage per act risk of getting HIV\\n\\nby exposure route to an infected source Exposure route Chance of infection Blood transfusion 90%[44] Childbirth (to child) 25%[45][ clarification needed ] Needle-sharing injection drug use 0.67%[46] Percutaneous needle stick 0.30%[47] Receptive anal intercourse* 0.04–3.0%[48] Insertive anal intercourse* 0.03%[49] Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.05–0.30%[48][50] Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.01–0.38%[48][50] Receptive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.04%[48] Insertive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.005%[51] * assuming no condom use\\n\\n§ source refers to oral intercourse\\n\\nperformed on a man\\n\\nHIV is spread by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission).[13] There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.[52] It is also possible to be co-infected by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.[53]\\n\\nSexual\\n\\nThe most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.[13] However, an HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.[54][55] The existence of functionally noncontagious HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy was controversially publicized in the 2008 Swiss Statement, and has since become accepted as medically sound.[56]\\n\\nGlobally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex;[13] however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2017 , most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (82% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70% of total new diagnoses).[57][58] In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.[59]\\n\\nWith regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.[60] In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.[60] The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4–1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.[60][61] While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present.[62] The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as \"nearly nil\";[63] however, a few cases have been reported.[64] The per-act risk is estimated at 0–0.04% for receptive oral intercourse.[65] In settings involving prostitution in low-income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.[60]\\n\\nRisk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections[66] and genital ulcers.[60] Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold.[60] Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission.[65]\\n\\nThe viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission.[67] During the first 2.5 months of an HIV infection a person\\'s infectiousness is twelve times higher due to the high viral load associated with acute HIV.[65] If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.[60]\\n\\nCommercial sex workers (including those in pornography) have an increased likelihood of contracting HIV.[68][69] Rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission.[70] Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.[71]\\n\\nBody fluids\\n\\nCDC poster from 1989 highlighting the threat of AIDS associated with drug use\\n\\nThe second-most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products.[13] Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle-stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63% and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%.[72] The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.[52] This risk may, however, be up to 5% if the introduced blood was from a person with a high viral load and the cut was deep.[73] In the United States, intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009,[74] and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive.[13]\\n\\nHIV is transmitted in about 90% of blood transfusions using infected blood.[44] In developed countries the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed;[13] for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million[75] and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008.[76] In low-income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008),[77] and it is estimated that up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.[13][78] It is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation, although this is rare because of screening.[79]\\n\\nUnsafe medical injections play a role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12% and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use.[80] The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%.[80] Risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this area of the world.[80]\\n\\nPeople giving or receiving tattoos, piercings, and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented.[81] It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV.[82]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nHIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV.[83][13] As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children.[84] In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20%, and in those who also breastfeed 35%.[84] Treatment decreases this risk to less than 5%.[85]\\n\\nAntiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the baby decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed.[86] If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.[81] If a woman is untreated, two years of breastfeeding results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%.[87] Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either exclusive breastfeeding or the provision of safe formula.[87] All women known to be HIV-positive should be taking lifelong antiretroviral therapy.[87]\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nDiagram of a HIV virion structure\\n\\nHIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.[88]\\n\\nHIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[89] part of the family Retroviridae.[90] Lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics. Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[91] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors.[92] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system.[93] Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.[94]\\n\\nHIV is now known to spread between CD4+ T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.[95] In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.[95] HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.[96][97] The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus\\'s ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.[95][98]\\n\\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more virulent, more infective,[99] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[100]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nHIV/AIDS explained in a simple way\\n\\nHIV replication cycle\\n\\nAfter the virus enters the body, there is a period of rapid viral replication, leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.[101] This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.[102]\\n\\nUltimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4+ T cells. This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.[103] During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.[104]\\n\\nAlthough the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.[105] The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co-receptor to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so.[106] A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.[107]\\n\\nHIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection.[108] A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected.[108] Continuous HIV replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase.[109] Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.[110]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n+ T cell counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection.

Since the WHO\\'s staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow a comparison for statistical purposes.[27][28][115]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.[28] Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.[28] The WHO system uses the following categories:\\n\\nPrimary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome [28]\\n\\nStage I: HIV infection is asymptomatic with a CD4 + T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. [28] May include generalized lymph node enlargement. [28]\\n\\nT cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. May include generalized lymph node enlargement. Stage II: Mild symptoms, which may include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. A CD4 count of less than 500/µl [28]\\n\\nStage III: Advanced symptoms, which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl [28]\\n\\nStage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms, which include toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, or lungs, and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl[28]\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008 and 2014.[115][116] This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups.[116] In those greater than six years of age it is:[116]\\n\\nStage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test.\\n\\nStage 1: CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µl or AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nUnknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications.\\n\\nFor surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4+ T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.[27]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPeople wearing AIDS awareness signs. On the left: \"Facing AIDS a condom and a pill at a time\"; on the right: \"I am Facing AIDS because people I ♥ are infected\"\\n\\nConsistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[117] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[118] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[119] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[120] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[121]\\n\\nCircumcision in sub-Saharan Africa \"reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months\".[122] Owing to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[123] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[124][125] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[126][127][128]\\n\\nPrograms encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[129] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[130] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high-risk behavior.[131][132] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[133] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[134] Enhanced family planning services appear to increase the likelihood of women with HIV using contraception, compared to basic services.[135] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[66]\\n\\nPre-exposure\\n\\nAntiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[136] TASP is associated with a 10- to 20-fold reduction in transmission risk.[136][137] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in people at high risk including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV-positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[120][138] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users, with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[139] The USPSTF, in 2019, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[140]\\n\\nUniversal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[141] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor, and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[142][143]\\n\\nPost-exposure\\n\\nA course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[144] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[144] As of 2013 , the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[145]\\n\\nPEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV-positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[146] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[147] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[52]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nPrograms to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[84][142] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant, and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[84][148] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[149] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[150] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[151]\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nCurrently there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009; it found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[152]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is currently no cure, nor an effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which slows progression of the disease.[153] As of 2010 , more than 6.6 million people were receiving HAART in low- and middle-income countries.[154] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections. As of July 2022 , four people have been successfully cleared of HIV.[155][156][157] Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy within one week of diagnosis appear to improve treatment outcomes in low and medium-income settings.[158]\\n\\nAntiviral therapy\\n\\nStribild – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of emtricitabine, – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of elvitegravir tenofovir and the booster cobicistat\\n\\nCurrent HAART options are combinations (or \"cocktails\") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or \"classes\", of antiretroviral agents.[159] Initially, treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).[160] Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).[160] As of 2019 , dolutegravir/lamivudine/tenofovir is listed by the World Health Organization as the first-line treatment for adults, with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz as an alternative.[161] Combinations of agents that include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.[159]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization and the United States recommend antiretrovirals in people of all ages (including pregnant women) as soon as the diagnosis is made, regardless of CD4 count.[26][162][163] Once treatment is begun, it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or \"holidays\".[31] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[31] The desired outcome of treatment is a long-term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[31] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[31] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[31] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[31]\\n\\nBenefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[164] In the developing world, treatment also improves physical and mental health.[165] With treatment, there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[159] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[159][166] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[31] Reasons for non-adherence to treatment include poor access to medical care,[167] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[168] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may reduce adherence.[169] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[170] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low- and middle-income countries as of 2010 ,[154] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[171]\\n\\nSpecific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[172] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[27] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[172][173] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[174] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[31] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[31]\\n\\nTreatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than five years of age; children above five are treated like adults.[175] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[176]\\n\\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.[177] The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation.[177] This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.[177]\\n\\nThe combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to a certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).[177]\\n\\nCabotegravir combined with rilpivirine (Cabenuva) is a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.[178][179]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections\\n\\nMeasures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[172]\\n\\nAdults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT); the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[180] Children with HIV may benefit from screening for tuberculosis.[181] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however, it may also be given after infection.[182]\\n\\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age, and ceasing breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, is recommended in resource-limited settings.[183] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person\\'s CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[184] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[185] Appropriate preventive measures reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[186] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[187][188]\\n\\nDiet\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[189] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV-positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[189][190][191][192] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections; however, evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[193]\\n\\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are up to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who are not tested positive with the virus.[194]\\n\\nEvidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[195] For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[196] If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[196] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[197]\\n\\nAlternative medicine\\n\\nIn the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[198] whose effectiveness has not been established.[199] There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[200] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[201]\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\n0 1–4 5–12 13–34 35–61 62–134 135–215 216–458 459–1,402 1,403–5,828 Deaths due to HIV/AIDS per million people in 2012:\\n\\nHIV/AIDS has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of the world.[202] Prognosis varies between people, and both the CD4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes.[30] Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[7] After the diagnosis of AIDS, if treatment is not available, survival ranges between 6 and 19 months.[203][204] HAART and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80%, and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20–50 years.[202][205][206] This is between two thirds[205] and nearly that of the general population.[31][207] If treatment is started late in the infection, prognosis is not as good:[31] for example, if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of AIDS, life expectancy is ~10–40 years.[31][202] Half of infants born with HIV die before two years of age without treatment.[183][clarification needed]\\n\\nThe primary causes of death from HIV/AIDS are opportunistic infections and cancer, both of which are frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system.[186][208] Risk of cancer appears to increase once the CD4 count is below 500/μL.[31] The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a person\\'s susceptibility and immune function;[209] their access to health care, the presence of co-infections;[203][210] and the particular strain (or strains) of the virus involved.[211][212]\\n\\nTuberculosis co-infection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with HIV/AIDS being present in a third of all HIV-infected people and causing 25% of HIV-related deaths.[213] HIV is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis.[214] Hepatitis C is another very common co-infection where each disease increases the progression of the other.[215] The two most common cancers associated with HIV/AIDS are Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[208] Other cancers that are more frequent include anal cancer, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31][216]\\n\\nEven with anti-retroviral treatment, over the long term HIV-infected people may experience neurocognitive disorders,[217] osteoporosis,[218] neuropathy,[219] cancers,[220][221] nephropathy,[222] and cardiovascular disease.[173] Some conditions, such as lipodystrophy, may be caused both by HIV and its treatment.[173]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nSee or edit source data. [223] Percentage of people with HIV/AIDS\\n\\n[223] Trends in new cases and deaths per year from HIV/AIDS\\n\\nSome authors consider HIV/AIDS a global pandemic.[224] As of 2016 , approximately 36.7 million people worldwide have HIV, the number of new infections that year being about 1.8 million.[225] This is down from 3.1 million new infections in 2001.[226] Slightly over half the infected population are women and 2.1 million are children.[225] It resulted in about 1 million deaths in 2016, down from a peak of 1.9 million in 2005.[225]\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected. In 2010, an estimated 68% (22.9 million) of all HIV cases and 66% of all deaths (1.2 million) occurred in this region.[227] This means that about 5% of the adult population is infected[228] and it is believed to be the cause of 10% of all deaths in children.[229] Here, in contrast to other regions, women comprise nearly 60% of cases.[227] South Africa has the largest population of people with HIV of any country in the world at 5.9 million.[227] Life expectancy has fallen in the worst-affected countries due to HIV/AIDS; for example, in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana.[24] Mother-to-child transmission in Botswana and South Africa, as of 2013 , has decreased to less than 5%, with improvement in many other African nations due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy.[230]\\n\\nSouth & South East Asia is the second most affected; in 2010 this region contained an estimated 4 million cases or 12% of all people living with HIV resulting in approximately 250,000 deaths.[228] Approximately 2.4 million of these cases are in India.[227]\\n\\nDuring 2008 in the United States approximately 1.2 million people aged ≥13 years were living with HIV, resulting in about 17,500 deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in that year, 236,400 people or 20% of infected Americans were unaware of their infection.[231] As of 2016 about 675,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the US since the beginning of the HIV epidemic.[232] In the United Kingdom as of 2015 , there were approximately 101,200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths.[233] In Canada as of 2008, there were about 65,000 cases causing 53 deaths.[234] Between the first recognition of AIDS (in 1981) and 2009, it has led to nearly 30 million deaths.[235] Rates of HIV are lowest in North Africa and the Middle East (0.1% or less), East Asia (0.1%), and Western and Central Europe (0.2%).[228] The worst-affected European countries, in 2009 and 2012 estimates, are Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Moldova, Portugal and Belarus, in decreasing order of prevalence.[236]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nDiscovery\\n\\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\". Thereported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\".\\n\\nThe first news story on the disease appeared on May 18, 1981, in the gay newspaper New York Native.[237][238] AIDS was first clinically reported on June 5, 1981, with five cases in the United States.[39][239] The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems.[240] Soon thereafter, a large number of homosexual men developed a generally rare skin cancer called Kaposi\\'s sarcoma (KS).[241][242] Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.[243]\\n\\nIn the early days, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of diseases associated with it, such as lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus.[244][245] They also used Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and opportunistic infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981.[246] At one point the CDC referred to it as the \"4H disease\", as the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and Haitians.[247][248] The term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had also been coined.[249] However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community,[246] it was realized that the term GRID was misleading, and the term AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982.[250] By September 1982 the CDC started referring to the disease as AIDS.[251]\\n\\nIn 1983, two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science.[252][245] Gallo claimed a virus which his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) that his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo\\'s group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier\\'s group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo\\'s group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier\\'s group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).[243] As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.[253]\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe origin of HIV / AIDS and the circumstances that led to its emergence remain unsolved.[254]\\n\\nBoth HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century.[21] HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes).[255][256] The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in coastal West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Ivory Coast).[100] New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.[257] HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.[258]\\n\\nThere is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[259] However, SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[260] Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century.\\n\\nSpecific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to c. 1910.[261] Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.[262] While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners has a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had syphilis.[262]\\n\\nAn alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa after World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.[260][263][264]\\n\\nThe earliest well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo.[265] The virus may have been present in the U.S. as early as the mid-to-late 1950s, as a sixteen-year-old male named Robert Rayford presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969. In the 1970s, there were cases of getting parasites and becoming sick with what was called \"gay bowel disease\", but what is now suspected to have been AIDS.[266]\\n\\nThe earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966, that of Arvid Noe.[267] In July 1960, in the wake of Congo\\'s independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium, who did not leave behind an African elite to run the country. By 1962, Haitians made up the second-largest group of well-educated experts (out of the 48 national groups recruited), that totaled around 4500 in the country.[268][269] Dr. Jacques Pépin, a Canadian author of The Origins of AIDS, stipulates that Haiti was one of HIV\\'s entry points to the U.S. and that a Haitian may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s.[269] Although there was known to have been at least one case of AIDS in the U.S. from 1966,[270] the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa (including the U.S.) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and brought the infection to the U.S. at some time around 1969.[254] The epidemic rapidly spread among high-risk groups (initially, sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men). By 1978, the prevalence of HIV-1 among gay male residents of New York City and San Francisco was estimated at 5%, suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected.[254]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nStigma\\n\\nAIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV-infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV-infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the quarantine of HIV-infected individuals.[17] Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.[272]\\n\\nAIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:\\n\\nInstrumental AIDS stigma —a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. [273]\\n\\n—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. Symbolic AIDS stigma —the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. [273]\\n\\n—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. Courtesy AIDS stigma—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV-positive people.[274]\\n\\nOften, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, and intravenous drug use.[275]\\n\\nIn many developed countries, there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality, and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual attitudes.[276] There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.[273] However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.[277] To get a better understanding of the anti-homosexual attitudes around AIDs the musical Rent explores this.[278]\\n\\nIn 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for those diagnosed with AIDS to marry in China.[279]\\n\\nIn 2013, the U.S. National Library of Medicine developed a traveling exhibition titled Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture;[280] this covered medical research, the U.S. government\\'s response, and personal stories from people with AIDS, caregivers, and activists.[281]\\n\\nEconomic impact\\n\\nChanges in life expectancy in some African countries, 1960–2012\\n\\nHIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.[229] The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.[229][282] Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. Before death they will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.[229] Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.[283]\\n\\nReturning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. Unemployment in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with suicidal ideation, memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases self-esteem, sense of dignity, confidence, and quality of life for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low-quality evidence).[284]\\n\\nBy affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS, resulting in increasing pressure on the state\\'s finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay, and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.[283]\\n\\nAt the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d\\'Ivoire showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.[285]\\n\\nReligion and AIDS\\n\\nThe topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.[286][287] The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis, argues that cultural changes are needed, including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.[287]\\n\\nSome religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the Hackney-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to many deaths.[288] The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertised an \"anointing water\" to promote God\\'s healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.[288]\\n\\nMedia portrayal\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American gay actor Rock Hudson. He had been diagnosed during 1984, announced that he had had the virus on July 25, 1985, and died a few months later on October 2, 1985.[289] Another notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden, a gay politician and son of former prime minister Anthony Eden.[290] On November 24, 1991, the virus claimed the life of British rock star Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen, who died from an AIDS-related illness having only revealed the diagnosis on the previous day.[291]\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile heterosexual cases of the virus was American tennis player Arthur Ashe. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive on August 31, 1988, having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s. Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS, but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992.[292] He died as a result on February 6, 1993, aged 49.[293]\\n\\nTherese Frare\\'s photograph of gay activist David Kirby, as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family, was taken in April 1990. Life magazine said the photo became the one image \"most powerfully identified with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\" The photo was displayed in Life, was the winner of the World Press Photo, and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a United Colors of Benetton advertising campaign in 1992.[294]\\n\\nMany famous artists and AIDS activists such as Larry Kramer, Diamanda Galás and Rosa von Praunheim[295] campaign for AIDS education and the rights of those affected. These artists worked with various media formats.\\n\\nCriminal transmission\\n\\nCriminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.[296] Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.\\n\\nIn 1996, Ugandan-born Canadian Johnson Aziga was diagnosed with HIV; he subsequently had unprotected sex with eleven women without disclosing his diagnosis. By 2003, seven had contracted HIV; two died from complications related to AIDS.[297][298] Aziga was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.[299]\\n\\nMisconceptions\\n\\nThere are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. Three misconceptions are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS,[300][301][302] and that HIV can infect only gay men and drug users.[303][304] In 2014, some among the British public wrongly thought one could get HIV from kissing (16%), sharing a glass (5%), spitting (16%), a public toilet seat (4%), and coughing or sneezing (5%).[305] Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection, and that open discussion of HIV and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of AIDS.[306][307]\\n\\nA small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS,[308] the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods.[309][310] These claims, known as AIDS denialism, have been examined and rejected by the scientific community.[311] However, they have had a significant political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government\\'s official embrace of AIDS denialism (1999–2005) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country\\'s AIDS epidemic, and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections.[312][313][314]\\n\\nSeveral discredited conspiracy theories have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. Operation INFEKTION was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed—and continue to believe—in such claims.[315]\\n\\nAt the peak of the HIV/AIDS outbreak, there was also misinformation spread from some governmental institutions. For example, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the AIDS outbreak, stated in the context of a conversation about childhood infections, “if the close contact of a child is a household contact, perhaps there will be a certain number of cases of individuals who are just living with and in close contact with someone with AIDS, or at risk of AIDS, who does not necessarily have to have intimate sexual contact or share a needle, but just the ordinary close contact that one sees in normal interpersonal relations.”[316] This and similar statements made by governmental agencies potentially fueled the unfounded fear that the public had that AIDS could be spread by ordinary close contact rather than through sexual or fluid transmission as is most commonly the case.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nHIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent, and about AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.\\n\\nMany governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[317] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[318][319]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with the Medical Wikipedia app. Wikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with theSpectrum of conditions caused by HIV infection\\n\\n\"AIDS\" and \"Aids\" redirect here. For other uses, see AIDS (disambiguation)\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),[9][10][11] a retrovirus.[12] Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[4] Typically, this is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms.[5] If the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function.[4] These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[5] This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[5]\\n\\nHIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and vaginal sex), contaminated hypodermic needles or blood transfusions, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[13] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat and tears, do not transmit the virus.[14] Oral sex has little to no risk of transmitting the virus.[15] Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, as well as both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.[4] Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication.[4]\\n\\nRecognized worldwide in the early 1980s,[16] HIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination.[17] The disease also has large economic impacts.[17] There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact.[18] The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church\\'s position not to support condom use as prevention.[19] It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.[20]\\n\\nHIV made the jump from other primates to humans in west-central Africa in the early-to-mid 20th century.[21] AIDS was first recognized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.[16] Between the first time AIDS was readily identified through 2021, the disease is estimated to have caused at least 40 million deaths worldwide.[22] In 2021, there were 650,000 deaths and about 38 million people worldwide living with HIV.[8] An estimated 20.6 million of these people live in eastern and southern Africa.[23] HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.[24]\\n\\nThe United States\\' National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Gates Foundation have pledged $200 million focused on developing a global cure for AIDS.[25] While there is no cure or vaccine, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.[5][6] Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.[26] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.[7]\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nThere are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency, and AIDS.[1][27]\\n\\nAcute infection\\n\\nMain symptoms of acute HIV infection\\n\\nThe initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.[27][28] Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms.[29][30] Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.[28][30] The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically.[31] Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage.[28] Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur.[30] Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occur.[30] The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.[30]\\n\\nOwing to their nonspecific character, these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection. Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms. Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection.[30]\\n\\nClinical latency\\n\\nThe initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.[1] Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years[32] to over 20 years[33] (on average, about eight years).[34] While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.[1] Between 50% and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.[27]\\n\\nAlthough most HIV-1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years.[30][35] These individuals are classified as \"HIV controllers\" or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP).[35] Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as \"elite controllers\" or \"elite suppressors\". They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.[36]\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome\\n\\nMain symptoms of AIDS\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection.[30] In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.[30] The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis.[30] Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections.[30]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system.[37] Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person\\'s environment.[30] These infections may affect nearly every organ system.[38]\\n\\nPeople with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31] Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is the most common cancer, occurring in 10% to 20% of people with HIV.[39] The second-most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3% to 4%.[39] Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).[39] Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV).[39] Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.[40]\\n\\nAdditionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and unintended weight loss.[41] Diarrhea is another common symptom, present in about 90% of people with AIDS.[42] They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.[43]\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nAverage per act risk of getting HIV\\n\\nby exposure route to an infected source Exposure route Chance of infection Blood transfusion 90%[44] Childbirth (to child) 25%[45][ clarification needed ] Needle-sharing injection drug use 0.67%[46] Percutaneous needle stick 0.30%[47] Receptive anal intercourse* 0.04–3.0%[48] Insertive anal intercourse* 0.03%[49] Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.05–0.30%[48][50] Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.01–0.38%[48][50] Receptive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.04%[48] Insertive oral intercourse*§ 0–0.005%[51] * assuming no condom use\\n\\n§ source refers to oral intercourse\\n\\nperformed on a man\\n\\nHIV is spread by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission).[13] There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.[52] It is also possible to be co-infected by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.[53]\\n\\nSexual\\n\\nThe most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.[13] However, an HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.[54][55] The existence of functionally noncontagious HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy was controversially publicized in the 2008 Swiss Statement, and has since become accepted as medically sound.[56]\\n\\nGlobally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex;[13] however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2017 , most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (82% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70% of total new diagnoses).[57][58] In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.[59]\\n\\nWith regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.[60] In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.[60] The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4–1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.[60][61] While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present.[62] The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as \"nearly nil\";[63] however, a few cases have been reported.[64] The per-act risk is estimated at 0–0.04% for receptive oral intercourse.[65] In settings involving prostitution in low-income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.[60]\\n\\nRisk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections[66] and genital ulcers.[60] Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold.[60] Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission.[65]\\n\\nThe viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission.[67] During the first 2.5 months of an HIV infection a person\\'s infectiousness is twelve times higher due to the high viral load associated with acute HIV.[65] If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.[60]\\n\\nCommercial sex workers (including those in pornography) have an increased likelihood of contracting HIV.[68][69] Rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission.[70] Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.[71]\\n\\nBody fluids\\n\\nCDC poster from 1989 highlighting the threat of AIDS associated with drug use\\n\\nThe second-most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products.[13] Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle-stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63% and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%.[72] The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.[52] This risk may, however, be up to 5% if the introduced blood was from a person with a high viral load and the cut was deep.[73] In the United States, intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009,[74] and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive.[13]\\n\\nHIV is transmitted in about 90% of blood transfusions using infected blood.[44] In developed countries the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed;[13] for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million[75] and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008.[76] In low-income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008),[77] and it is estimated that up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.[13][78] It is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation, although this is rare because of screening.[79]\\n\\nUnsafe medical injections play a role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12% and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use.[80] The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%.[80] Risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this area of the world.[80]\\n\\nPeople giving or receiving tattoos, piercings, and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented.[81] It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV.[82]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nHIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV.[83][13] As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children.[84] In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20%, and in those who also breastfeed 35%.[84] Treatment decreases this risk to less than 5%.[85]\\n\\nAntiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the baby decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed.[86] If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.[81] If a woman is untreated, two years of breastfeeding results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%.[87] Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either exclusive breastfeeding or the provision of safe formula.[87] All women known to be HIV-positive should be taking lifelong antiretroviral therapy.[87]\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nDiagram of a HIV virion structure\\n\\nHIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.[88]\\n\\nHIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[89] part of the family Retroviridae.[90] Lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics. Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[91] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors.[92] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system.[93] Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.[94]\\n\\nHIV is now known to spread between CD4+ T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.[95] In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.[95] HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.[96][97] The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus\\'s ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.[95][98]\\n\\nTwo types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more virulent, more infective,[99] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[100]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nHIV/AIDS explained in a simple way\\n\\nHIV replication cycle\\n\\nAfter the virus enters the body, there is a period of rapid viral replication, leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.[101] This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.[102]\\n\\nUltimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4+ T cells. This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.[103] During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.[104]\\n\\nAlthough the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.[105] The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co-receptor to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so.[106] A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.[107]\\n\\nHIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection.[108] A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected.[108] Continuous HIV replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase.[109] Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.[110]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n+ T cell counts over the average course of untreated HIV infection.

Since the WHO\\'s staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow a comparison for statistical purposes.[27][28][115]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.[28] Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.[28] The WHO system uses the following categories:\\n\\nPrimary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome [28]\\n\\nStage I: HIV infection is asymptomatic with a CD4 + T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. [28] May include generalized lymph node enlargement. [28]\\n\\nT cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. May include generalized lymph node enlargement. Stage II: Mild symptoms, which may include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. A CD4 count of less than 500/µl [28]\\n\\nStage III: Advanced symptoms, which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl [28]\\n\\nStage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms, which include toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, or lungs, and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl[28]\\n\\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008 and 2014.[115][116] This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups.[116] In those greater than six years of age it is:[116]\\n\\nStage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test.\\n\\nStage 1: CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500 cells/µl and no AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nStage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/µl or AIDS-defining conditions.\\n\\nUnknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications.\\n\\nFor surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4+ T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.[27]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPeople wearing AIDS awareness signs. On the left: \"Facing AIDS a condom and a pill at a time\"; on the right: \"I am Facing AIDS because people I ♥ are infected\"\\n\\nConsistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[117] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[118] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[119] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[120] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[121]\\n\\nCircumcision in sub-Saharan Africa \"reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months\".[122] Owing to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[123] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[124][125] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[126][127][128]\\n\\nPrograms encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[129] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[130] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high-risk behavior.[131][132] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[133] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[134] Enhanced family planning services appear to increase the likelihood of women with HIV using contraception, compared to basic services.[135] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[66]\\n\\nPre-exposure\\n\\nAntiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[136] TASP is associated with a 10- to 20-fold reduction in transmission risk.[136][137] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in people at high risk including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV-positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[120][138] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users, with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[139] The USPSTF, in 2019, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[140]\\n\\nUniversal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[141] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor, and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[142][143]\\n\\nPost-exposure\\n\\nA course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[144] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[144] As of 2013 , the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[145]\\n\\nPEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV-positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[146] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[147] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[52]\\n\\nMother-to-child\\n\\nPrograms to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[84][142] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant, and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[84][148] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[149] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[150] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[151]\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nCurrently there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009; it found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[152]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is currently no cure, nor an effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which slows progression of the disease.[153] As of 2010 , more than 6.6 million people were receiving HAART in low- and middle-income countries.[154] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections. As of July 2022 , four people have been successfully cleared of HIV.[155][156][157] Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy within one week of diagnosis appear to improve treatment outcomes in low and medium-income settings.[158]\\n\\nAntiviral therapy\\n\\nStribild – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of emtricitabine, – a common once-daily ART regime consisting of elvitegravir tenofovir and the booster cobicistat\\n\\nCurrent HAART options are combinations (or \"cocktails\") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or \"classes\", of antiretroviral agents.[159] Initially, treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).[160] Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).[160] As of 2019 , dolutegravir/lamivudine/tenofovir is listed by the World Health Organization as the first-line treatment for adults, with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz as an alternative.[161] Combinations of agents that include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.[159]\\n\\nThe World Health Organization and the United States recommend antiretrovirals in people of all ages (including pregnant women) as soon as the diagnosis is made, regardless of CD4 count.[26][162][163] Once treatment is begun, it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or \"holidays\".[31] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[31] The desired outcome of treatment is a long-term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[31] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[31] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[31] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[31]\\n\\nBenefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[164] In the developing world, treatment also improves physical and mental health.[165] With treatment, there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[159] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[159][166] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[31] Reasons for non-adherence to treatment include poor access to medical care,[167] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[168] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may reduce adherence.[169] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[170] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low- and middle-income countries as of 2010 ,[154] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[171]\\n\\nSpecific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[172] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[27] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[172][173] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[174] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[31] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[31]\\n\\nTreatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than five years of age; children above five are treated like adults.[175] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[176]\\n\\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.[177] The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation.[177] This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.[177]\\n\\nThe combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to a certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).[177]\\n\\nCabotegravir combined with rilpivirine (Cabenuva) is a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.[178][179]\\n\\nOpportunistic infections\\n\\nMeasures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[172]\\n\\nAdults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT); the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[180] Children with HIV may benefit from screening for tuberculosis.[181] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however, it may also be given after infection.[182]\\n\\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age, and ceasing breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, is recommended in resource-limited settings.[183] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person\\'s CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[184] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[185] Appropriate preventive measures reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[186] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[187][188]\\n\\nDiet\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[189] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV-positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[189][190][191][192] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections; however, evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[193]\\n\\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are up to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who are not tested positive with the virus.[194]\\n\\nEvidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[195] For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[196] If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[196] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[197]\\n\\nAlternative medicine\\n\\nIn the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[198] whose effectiveness has not been established.[199] There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[200] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[201]\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\n0 1–4 5–12 13–34 35–61 62–134 135–215 216–458 459–1,402 1,403–5,828 Deaths due to HIV/AIDS per million people in 2012:\\n\\nHIV/AIDS has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of the world.[202] Prognosis varies between people, and both the CD4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes.[30] Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[7] After the diagnosis of AIDS, if treatment is not available, survival ranges between 6 and 19 months.[203][204] HAART and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80%, and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20–50 years.[202][205][206] This is between two thirds[205] and nearly that of the general population.[31][207] If treatment is started late in the infection, prognosis is not as good:[31] for example, if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of AIDS, life expectancy is ~10–40 years.[31][202] Half of infants born with HIV die before two years of age without treatment.[183][clarification needed]\\n\\nThe primary causes of death from HIV/AIDS are opportunistic infections and cancer, both of which are frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system.[186][208] Risk of cancer appears to increase once the CD4 count is below 500/μL.[31] The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a person\\'s susceptibility and immune function;[209] their access to health care, the presence of co-infections;[203][210] and the particular strain (or strains) of the virus involved.[211][212]\\n\\nTuberculosis co-infection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with HIV/AIDS being present in a third of all HIV-infected people and causing 25% of HIV-related deaths.[213] HIV is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis.[214] Hepatitis C is another very common co-infection where each disease increases the progression of the other.[215] The two most common cancers associated with HIV/AIDS are Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.[208] Other cancers that are more frequent include anal cancer, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[31][216]\\n\\nEven with anti-retroviral treatment, over the long term HIV-infected people may experience neurocognitive disorders,[217] osteoporosis,[218] neuropathy,[219] cancers,[220][221] nephropathy,[222] and cardiovascular disease.[173] Some conditions, such as lipodystrophy, may be caused both by HIV and its treatment.[173]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nSee or edit source data. [223] Percentage of people with HIV/AIDS\\n\\n[223] Trends in new cases and deaths per year from HIV/AIDS\\n\\nSome authors consider HIV/AIDS a global pandemic.[224] As of 2016 , approximately 36.7 million people worldwide have HIV, the number of new infections that year being about 1.8 million.[225] This is down from 3.1 million new infections in 2001.[226] Slightly over half the infected population are women and 2.1 million are children.[225] It resulted in about 1 million deaths in 2016, down from a peak of 1.9 million in 2005.[225]\\n\\nSub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected. In 2010, an estimated 68% (22.9 million) of all HIV cases and 66% of all deaths (1.2 million) occurred in this region.[227] This means that about 5% of the adult population is infected[228] and it is believed to be the cause of 10% of all deaths in children.[229] Here, in contrast to other regions, women comprise nearly 60% of cases.[227] South Africa has the largest population of people with HIV of any country in the world at 5.9 million.[227] Life expectancy has fallen in the worst-affected countries due to HIV/AIDS; for example, in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana.[24] Mother-to-child transmission in Botswana and South Africa, as of 2013 , has decreased to less than 5%, with improvement in many other African nations due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy.[230]\\n\\nSouth & South East Asia is the second most affected; in 2010 this region contained an estimated 4 million cases or 12% of all people living with HIV resulting in approximately 250,000 deaths.[228] Approximately 2.4 million of these cases are in India.[227]\\n\\nDuring 2008 in the United States approximately 1.2 million people aged ≥13 years were living with HIV, resulting in about 17,500 deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in that year, 236,400 people or 20% of infected Americans were unaware of their infection.[231] As of 2016 about 675,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the US since the beginning of the HIV epidemic.[232] In the United Kingdom as of 2015 , there were approximately 101,200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths.[233] In Canada as of 2008, there were about 65,000 cases causing 53 deaths.[234] Between the first recognition of AIDS (in 1981) and 2009, it has led to nearly 30 million deaths.[235] Rates of HIV are lowest in North Africa and the Middle East (0.1% or less), East Asia (0.1%), and Western and Central Europe (0.2%).[228] The worst-affected European countries, in 2009 and 2012 estimates, are Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Moldova, Portugal and Belarus, in decreasing order of prevalence.[236]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nDiscovery\\n\\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report reported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\". Thereported in 1981 on what was later to be called \"AIDS\".\\n\\nThe first news story on the disease appeared on May 18, 1981, in the gay newspaper New York Native.[237][238] AIDS was first clinically reported on June 5, 1981, with five cases in the United States.[39][239] The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems.[240] Soon thereafter, a large number of homosexual men developed a generally rare skin cancer called Kaposi\\'s sarcoma (KS).[241][242] Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.[243]\\n\\nIn the early days, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of diseases associated with it, such as lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus.[244][245] They also used Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and opportunistic infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981.[246] At one point the CDC referred to it as the \"4H disease\", as the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and Haitians.[247][248] The term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had also been coined.[249] However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community,[246] it was realized that the term GRID was misleading, and the term AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982.[250] By September 1982 the CDC started referring to the disease as AIDS.[251]\\n\\nIn 1983, two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science.[252][245] Gallo claimed a virus which his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) that his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo\\'s group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier\\'s group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo\\'s group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier\\'s group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).[243] As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.[253]\\n\\nOrigins\\n\\nThe origin of HIV / AIDS and the circumstances that led to its emergence remain unsolved.[254]\\n\\nBoth HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century.[21] HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes).[255][256] The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in coastal West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Ivory Coast).[100] New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.[257] HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.[258]\\n\\nThere is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[259] However, SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[260] Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century.\\n\\nSpecific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to c. 1910.[261] Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.[262] While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners has a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had syphilis.[262]\\n\\nAn alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa after World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.[260][263][264]\\n\\nThe earliest well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo.[265] The virus may have been present in the U.S. as early as the mid-to-late 1950s, as a sixteen-year-old male named Robert Rayford presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969. In the 1970s, there were cases of getting parasites and becoming sick with what was called \"gay bowel disease\", but what is now suspected to have been AIDS.[266]\\n\\nThe earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966, that of Arvid Noe.[267] In July 1960, in the wake of Congo\\'s independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium, who did not leave behind an African elite to run the country. By 1962, Haitians made up the second-largest group of well-educated experts (out of the 48 national groups recruited), that totaled around 4500 in the country.[268][269] Dr. Jacques Pépin, a Canadian author of The Origins of AIDS, stipulates that Haiti was one of HIV\\'s entry points to the U.S. and that a Haitian may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s.[269] Although there was known to have been at least one case of AIDS in the U.S. from 1966,[270] the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa (including the U.S.) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and brought the infection to the U.S. at some time around 1969.[254] The epidemic rapidly spread among high-risk groups (initially, sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men). By 1978, the prevalence of HIV-1 among gay male residents of New York City and San Francisco was estimated at 5%, suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected.[254]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nStigma\\n\\nAIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV-infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV-infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the quarantine of HIV-infected individuals.[17] Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.[272]\\n\\nAIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:\\n\\nInstrumental AIDS stigma —a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. [273]\\n\\n—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness. Symbolic AIDS stigma —the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. [273]\\n\\n—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease. Courtesy AIDS stigma—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV-positive people.[274]\\n\\nOften, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, and intravenous drug use.[275]\\n\\nIn many developed countries, there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality, and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual attitudes.[276] There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.[273] However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.[277] To get a better understanding of the anti-homosexual attitudes around AIDs the musical Rent explores this.[278]\\n\\nIn 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for those diagnosed with AIDS to marry in China.[279]\\n\\nIn 2013, the U.S. National Library of Medicine developed a traveling exhibition titled Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture;[280] this covered medical research, the U.S. government\\'s response, and personal stories from people with AIDS, caregivers, and activists.[281]\\n\\nEconomic impact\\n\\nChanges in life expectancy in some African countries, 1960–2012\\n\\nHIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.[229] The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.[229][282] Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. Before death they will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.[229] Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.[283]\\n\\nReturning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. Unemployment in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with suicidal ideation, memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases self-esteem, sense of dignity, confidence, and quality of life for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low-quality evidence).[284]\\n\\nBy affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS, resulting in increasing pressure on the state\\'s finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay, and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.[283]\\n\\nAt the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d\\'Ivoire showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.[285]\\n\\nReligion and AIDS\\n\\nThe topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.[286][287] The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis, argues that cultural changes are needed, including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.[287]\\n\\nSome religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the Hackney-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to many deaths.[288] The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertised an \"anointing water\" to promote God\\'s healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.[288]\\n\\nMedia portrayal\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American gay actor Rock Hudson. He had been diagnosed during 1984, announced that he had had the virus on July 25, 1985, and died a few months later on October 2, 1985.[289] Another notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden, a gay politician and son of former prime minister Anthony Eden.[290] On November 24, 1991, the virus claimed the life of British rock star Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen, who died from an AIDS-related illness having only revealed the diagnosis on the previous day.[291]\\n\\nOne of the first high-profile heterosexual cases of the virus was American tennis player Arthur Ashe. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive on August 31, 1988, having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s. Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS, but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992.[292] He died as a result on February 6, 1993, aged 49.[293]\\n\\nTherese Frare\\'s photograph of gay activist David Kirby, as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family, was taken in April 1990. Life magazine said the photo became the one image \"most powerfully identified with the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\" The photo was displayed in Life, was the winner of the World Press Photo, and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a United Colors of Benetton advertising campaign in 1992.[294]\\n\\nMany famous artists and AIDS activists such as Larry Kramer, Diamanda Galás and Rosa von Praunheim[295] campaign for AIDS education and the rights of those affected. These artists worked with various media formats.\\n\\nCriminal transmission\\n\\nCriminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.[296] Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.\\n\\nIn 1996, Ugandan-born Canadian Johnson Aziga was diagnosed with HIV; he subsequently had unprotected sex with eleven women without disclosing his diagnosis. By 2003, seven had contracted HIV; two died from complications related to AIDS.[297][298] Aziga was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.[299]\\n\\nMisconceptions\\n\\nThere are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. Three misconceptions are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS,[300][301][302] and that HIV can infect only gay men and drug users.[303][304] In 2014, some among the British public wrongly thought one could get HIV from kissing (16%), sharing a glass (5%), spitting (16%), a public toilet seat (4%), and coughing or sneezing (5%).[305] Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection, and that open discussion of HIV and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of AIDS.[306][307]\\n\\nA small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS,[308] the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods.[309][310] These claims, known as AIDS denialism, have been examined and rejected by the scientific community.[311] However, they have had a significant political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government\\'s official embrace of AIDS denialism (1999–2005) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country\\'s AIDS epidemic, and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections.[312][313][314]\\n\\nSeveral discredited conspiracy theories have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. Operation INFEKTION was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed—and continue to believe—in such claims.[315]\\n\\nAt the peak of the HIV/AIDS outbreak, there was also misinformation spread from some governmental institutions. For example, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the AIDS outbreak, stated in the context of a conversation about childhood infections, “if the close contact of a child is a household contact, perhaps there will be a certain number of cases of individuals who are just living with and in close contact with someone with AIDS, or at risk of AIDS, who does not necessarily have to have intimate sexual contact or share a needle, but just the ordinary close contact that one sees in normal interpersonal relations.”[316] This and similar statements made by governmental agencies potentially fueled the unfounded fear that the public had that AIDS could be spread by ordinary close contact rather than through sexual or fluid transmission as is most commonly the case.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nHIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent, and about AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.\\n\\nMany governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[317] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[318][319]\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nWikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with the Medical Wikipedia app. Wikipedia\\'s health care articles can be viewed offline with theRaised body temperature due to illness\\n\\nThis article is about the medical condition. For other uses, see Fever (disambiguation)\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nFever, also referred to as pyrexia, is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body\\'s temperature set point.[5][6][12][7] There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.2 and 38.3 °C (99.0 and 100.9 °F) in humans.[1][7][8] The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills.[2] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.[3] When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.[3] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure, with this being more common in young children.[4] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (106 to 108 °F).[6]\\n\\nA fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening.[13] This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections—such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa, COVID-19, and malaria.[13][14] Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer.[13][15] It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.[1]\\n\\nTreatment to reduce fever is generally not required.[2][9] Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest.[9] Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature.[9][10] Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms.[16] Hyperthermia requires treatment.[2]\\n\\nFever is one of the most common medical signs.[2] It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children[2] and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.[11] While fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes.[17][18][19] Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia.[2][20][attribution needed]\\n\\nAssociated symptoms [ edit ]\\n\\nA fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, dehydration,[21][22] and the inability to concentrate. Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called \"fever dreams\".[23] Mild to severe delirium (which can also cause hallucinations) may also present itself during high fevers.[24]\\n\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\n\\nA range for normal temperatures has been found.[8] Central temperatures, such as rectal temperatures, are more accurate than peripheral temperatures.[30] Fever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature[31] is caused by a raised set point and:\\n\\nTemperature in the anus (rectum/rectal) is at or over 37.5–38.3 °C (99.5–100.9 °F) [1] [8] An ear (tympanic) or forehead (temporal) temperature may also be used. [32] [33]\\n\\nAn ear (tympanic) or forehead (temporal) temperature may also be used. Temperature in the mouth (oral) is at or over 37.2 °C (99.0 °F) in the morning or over 37.7 °C (99.9 °F) in the afternoon [7] [34]\\n\\nTemperature under the arm (axillary) is usually about 0.6 °C (1.1 °F) below core body temperature.[35]\\n\\nIn adults, the normal range of oral temperatures in healthy individuals is 35.7–37.7 °C (96.3–99.9 °F) among men and 33.2–38.1 °C (91.8–100.6 °F) among women, while when taken rectally it is 36.7–37.5 °C (98.1–99.5 °F) among men and 36.8–37.1 °C (98.2–98.8 °F) among women, and for ear measurement it is 35.5–37.5 °C (95.9–99.5 °F) among men and 35.7–37.5 °C (96.3–99.5 °F) among women.[36]\\n\\nNormal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more.[37][38] Normal daily temperature variation has been described as 0.5 °C (0.9 °F).[7]: 4012 A raised temperature is not always a fever.[37] For example, the temperature rises in healthy people when they exercise, but this is not considered a fever, as the set point is normal.[37] On the other hand, a \"normal\" temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person; for example, medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a \"normal\" temperature of 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) may represent a clinically significant fever.[37][39]\\n\\nHyperthermia [ edit ]\\n\\nHyperthermia is an elevation of body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.[1][7] Hyperthermia is thus not considered fever.[7]: 103 [40] Hyperthermia should not be confused with hyperpyrexia (which is a very high fever).[7]: 102\\n\\nClinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes.[7]: 103\\n\\nTypes [ edit ]\\n\\nDifferent fever patterns observed in Plasmodium infections\\n\\nVarious patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis:\\n\\nAmong the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are:[48][49]\\n\\nIn addition, there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma—the Pel–Ebstein fever, with patients argued to present high temperature for one week, followed by low for the next week, and so on, where the generality of this pattern is debated.[52][53]\\n\\nPersistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called fever of unknown origin.[7][54] A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function.[55] Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention.[56] This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people.[55][57]\\n\\nHyperpyrexia [ edit ]\\n\\nHyperpyrexia is an extreme elevation of body temperature which, depending upon the source, is classified as a core body temperature greater than or equal to 40 or 41 °C (104 or 106 °F); the range of hyperpyrexias includes cases considered severe (≥ 40 °C) and extreme (≥ 42 °C).[7][58][59] It differs from hyperthermia in that one\\'s thermoregulatory system\\'s set point for body temperature is set above normal, then heat is generated to achieve it. In contrast, hyperthermia involves body temperature rising above its set point due to outside factors.[7][60] The high temperatures of hyperpyrexia are considered medical emergencies, as they may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to severe morbidity (including permanent brain damage), or to death.[61] A common cause of hyperpyrexia is an intracranial hemorrhage.[7] Other causes in emergency room settings include sepsis, Kawasaki syndrome,[62] neuroleptic malignant syndrome, drug overdose, serotonin syndrome, and thyroid storm.[61]\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis [ edit ]\\n\\nFever is a common symptom of many medical conditions:\\n\\nAdult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in COVID-19, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.[14]\\n\\nIn addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.[75]\\n\\nTeething is not a cause of fever.[76]\\n\\nFunction [ edit ]\\n\\n\\n\\nHypothermia: Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while the hypothermic temperature is shown in blue. As can be seen, hypothermia can be conceptualized as a decrease below the thermoregulatory set point.\\n\\nFever: Characterized on the right: Normal body temperature is shown in green.

It reads \"New Normal\" because the thermoregulatory set point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic.\\n\\nImmune function [ edit ]\\n\\nFever is thought to contribute to host defense,[17] as the reproduction of pathogens with strict temperature requirements can be hindered, and the rates of some important immunological reactions are increased by temperature.[77] Fever has been described in teaching texts as assisting the healing process in various ways, including:\\n\\nAdvantages and disadvantages [ edit ]\\n\\nHaving a fever response in response to an infectious disease is generally regarded as protective, whereas fever in non-infections may be maladaptive.[80][81] Studies have not been consistent on whether treating fever generally worsens or improves mortality risk.[82] Benefits or harms may depend on the type of infection, health status of the patient and other factors.[80] Studies using warm-blooded vertebrates suggest that they recover more rapidly from infections or critical illness due to fever.[83] In sepsis, fever is associated with reduced mortality.[84]\\n\\nPathophysiology of fever induction [ edit ]\\n\\nHypothalamus [ edit ]\\n\\nTemperature is regulated in the hypothalamus. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response.[85] Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a thermostat.[7] When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate.[86]\\n\\nIf these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:[citation needed]\\n\\nIncreased heat production by increased muscle tone, shivering (muscle movements to produce heat) and release of hormones like epinephrine; and\\n\\nPrevention of heat loss, e.g., through vasoconstriction.\\n\\nWhen the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline—either spontaneously or via medication—normal functions such as sweating, and the reverse of the foregoing processes (e.g., vasodilation, end of shivering, and nonshivering heat production) are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.[citation needed]\\n\\nThis contrasts with hyperthermia, in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat. Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment (heat stroke) or an adverse reaction to drugs. Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to anti-pyretic medications.[7][verification needed]\\n\\nIn infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat (non-exercise-associated thermogenesis, also known as non-shivering thermogenesis).[citation needed]\\n\\nIncreased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever.[citation needed]\\n\\nPyrogens [ edit ]\\n\\nA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever.[87] In the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria, viruses, viroids, etc., the immune response of the body is to inhibit their growth and eliminate them. The most common pyrogens are endotoxins, which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. But pyrogens include non-endotoxic substances (derived from microorganisms other than gram-negative-bacteria or from chemical substances) as well.[88] The types of pyrogens include internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) to the body.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe \"pyrogenicity\" of given pyrogens varies: in extreme cases, bacterial pyrogens can act as superantigens and cause rapid and dangerous fevers.[89]\\n\\nEndogenous [ edit ]\\n\\nEndogenous pyrogens are cytokines released from monocytes (which are part of the immune system).[90] In general, they stimulate chemical responses, often in the presence of an antigen, leading to a fever. Whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens, they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.[91]\\n\\nMajor endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (α and β)[92]: 1237–1248 and interleukin 6 (IL-6).[93] Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-β, macrophage inflammatory protein-α and macrophage inflammatory protein-β as well as interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ.[92]: 1237–1248 Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) also acts as a pyrogen, mediated by interleukin 1 (IL-1) release.[94] These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the brain\\'s circumventricular organs where they are more easily absorbed than in areas protected by the blood–brain barrier.[citation needed] The cytokines then bind to endothelial receptors on vessel walls to receptors on microglial cells, resulting in activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.[citation needed]\\n\\nOf these, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever. These proteins produce a cyclooxygenase which induces the hypothalamic production of PGE2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature.[95]\\n\\nExogenous [ edit ]\\n\\nExogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin. In general, these pyrogens, including bacterial cell wall products, may act on Toll-like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint.[96]\\n\\nAn example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. According to one mechanism of pyrogen action, an immune system protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), binds to LPS, and the LBP–LPS complex then binds to a CD14 receptor on a macrophage. The LBP-LPS binding to CD14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokines, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). A further downstream event is activation of the arachidonic acid pathway.[97]\\n\\nPGE2 release [ edit ]\\n\\nPGE2 release comes from the arachidonic acid pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.[citation needed]\\n\\nPGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area (POA) through the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.[citation needed]\\n\\nManagement [ edit ]\\n\\nFever does not necessarily need to be treated,[98] and most people with a fever recover without specific medical attention.[99] Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated.[100] Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 42.0 °C (107.6 °F), and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40.6 °C (105.1 °F).[101] Treating fever in people with sepsis does not affect outcomes.[102] Small trials have shown no benefit of treating fevers of 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) or higher of critically ill patients in ICUs, and one trial was terminated early because patients receiving aggressive fever treatment were dying more often.[19]\\n\\nAccording to the NIH, the two assumptions which are generally used to argue in favor of treating fevers have not been experimentally validated. These are that (1) a fever is noxious, and (2) suppression of a fever will reduce its noxious effect. Most of the other studies supporting the association of fever with poorer outcomes have been observational in nature. In theory, these critically ill patients and those faced with additional physiologic stress may benefit from fever reduction, but the evidence on both sides of the argument appears to be mostly equivocal.[19]\\n\\nConservative measures [ edit ]\\n\\nLimited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water.[103] The use of a fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water).[61] In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated.[104] Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.[105]\\n\\nMedications [ edit ]\\n\\nMedications that lower fevers are called antipyretics.[106] The antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fevers in children.[107] It is more effective than acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children.[107] Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers.[108][109] The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned.[110] Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with fevers.[111] Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye\\'s syndrome.[112]\\n\\nUsing both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen.[113] It is not clear if it increases child comfort.[113] Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.[114]\\n\\nWith respect to the effect of antipyretics on the risk of death in those with infection, studies have found mixed results as of 2019.[115] Animal models have found worsened outcomes with the use of antipyretics in influenza as of 2010 but they have not been studied for this use in humans.[116]\\n\\nEpidemiology [ edit ]\\n\\nFever is one of the most common medical signs.[2] It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children,[2] and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick.[11] About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.[117]\\n\\nHistory [ edit ]\\n\\nA number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when Hippocrates was practicing medicine including that due to malaria (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days).[118] It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.[118]\\n\\nInfections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Until the late nineteenth century, approximately half of all humans died from infections before the age of fifteen.[119]\\n\\nAn older term, febricula (a diminutive form of the Latin word for fever), was once used to refer to a low-grade fever lasting only a few days. This term fell out of use in the early 20th century, and the symptoms it referred to are now thought to have been caused mainly by various minor viral respiratory infections.[120]\\n\\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\\n\\nMythology [ edit ]\\n\\nFebris\\n\\nFebris ( fever in Latin) is the goddess of fever in Roman mythology. People with fevers would visit her temples.\\n\\nin Latin) is the goddess of fever in Roman mythology. People with fevers would visit her temples. Tertiana and Quartana are the goddesses of tertian and quartan fevers of malaria in Roman mythology. [121]\\n\\nJvarasura (fever-demon in Hindi) is the personification of fever and disease in Hindu and Buddhist mythology.\\n\\nPaediatrics [ edit ]\\n\\nFever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia,[2][122] which is based in both caregiver\\'s and parents\\' misconceptions about fever in children. Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a disease rather than a medical sign, that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified \"normal\" number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever.[122] They are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers.[122] The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is that \"as parents we tend to suspect that our children\\'s brains may melt.\"[123] As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child\\'s sleep to give the child more medicine.[122]\\n\\nOther species [ edit ]\\n\\nFever is an important metric for the diagnosis of disease in domestic animals. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a horse is said to have a fever above 101 °F (38.3 °C).[124] In species that allow the body to have a wide range of \"normal\" temperatures, such as camels,[125] whose body temperature varies as the environmental temperature varies,[126] the body temperature which constitutes a febrile state differs depending on the environmental temperature.[127] Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever. For instance, some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2–5 °C higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium acridum.[128] Honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite Ascosphaera apis.[128]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nFurther reading [ edit ]Not to be confused with Miliaria\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals.[5][6][3] Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.[1][7] In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.[1] Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.[3] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[3] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[1] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[1]\\n\\nMalaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.[3] It is spread exclusively through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.[3][8] The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito\\'s saliva into a person\\'s blood.[3] The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce.[1] Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans.[1] Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.[1][3] The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans.[3] Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.[1] Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite\\'s DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.[9]\\n\\nThe risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water.[1] Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease is common.[3] Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria.[3] As of 2020, there is one vaccine which has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa.[10][11] A pre-print study of another vaccine has shown 77% vaccine efficacy.[needs update][12] Efforts to develop more effective vaccines are ongoing.[11] The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes artemisinin.[13][4][1][3] The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.[14] Quinine, along with doxycycline, may be used if artemisinin is not available.[14] It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance.[3] Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.[3]\\n\\nThe disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator.[15][1] This includes much of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[3] In 2021 there were 247 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 619,000 deaths. Approximately 95% of the cases and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Rates of disease decreased from 2010 to 2014 but increased from 2015 to 2021.[4] Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on economic development.[16][17] In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and adverse effects on tourism.[18]\\n\\nSigns and complications [ edit ]\\n\\n[19] Main symptoms of malaria\\n\\nAdults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever – classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours, followed by a period of sweating and fever relief – as well as headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain.[20] Children tend to have more general symptoms: fever, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea.[20]\\n\\nInitial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms,[21] and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases.[9] The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.[22]\\n\\nThe classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian fever) in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for P. malariae. P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.[23]\\n\\nSymptoms typically begin 10–15 days after the initial mosquito bite, but can occur as late as several months after infection with some P. vivax strains.[20] Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs.[20]\\n\\nSevere malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.[21] Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.[21]\\n\\nComplications [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria has several serious complications. Among these is the development of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P. falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.[24] Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality.[25] Kidney failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.[21]\\n\\nInfection with P. falciparum may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.[26] An enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and haemoglobin in the urine with kidney failure may occur.[21] Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.[27]\\n\\nMalaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths, infant mortality, miscarriage and low birth weight,[28] particularly in P. falciparum infection, but also with P. vivax.[29]\\n\\nCause [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus Plasmodium.[30] In humans, malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P. vivax and P. knowlesi.[31] Among those infected, P. falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%).[9] Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,[32] recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.[33] P. vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa.[34] There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes; however, except for P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques[35]—these are mostly of limited public health importance.[36]\\n\\nThe life cycle of malaria parasites. Sporozoites are introduced by a mosquito bite. They migrate to the liver, where they multiply into thousands of merozoites. The merozoites infect red blood cells and replicate, infecting more and more red blood cells. Some parasites form gametocytes, which are taken up by a mosquito, continuing the life cycle.\\n\\nParasites are typically introduced by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. What these inoculated parasites, called \"sporozoites\", do in the skin and lymphatics, exactly, has yet to be accurately determined.[37] However, a percentage of sporozoites follow the bloodstream to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes.[38] They grow and divide in the liver for 2–10 days, with each infected hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40,000 parasites.[38] The infected hepatocytes break down, releasing this invasive form of Plasmodium cells, called \"merozoites\" into the bloodstream. In the blood, the merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells, replicating over 24–72 hours to form 16–32 new merozoites.[38] The infected red blood cell lyses, and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells, resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of parasites in an infected person.[38] However, most of the P. vivax replicating merozoite biomass is now (since 2021) known to be hidden in the spleen and bone marrow (perhaps elsewhere too), thereby supporting the astute, long-standing (since 2011) but previously ignored theory that non-circulating merozoites are the source many P. vivax malarial recurrences (see “Recurrent malaria” section below).[39] Over rounds of this red blood cell infection cycle in the bloodstream and elsewhere, a small portion of parasites do not replicate, but instead develop into early sexual stage parasites called male and female \"gametocytes\". These gametocytes develop in the bone marrow for 11 days, then return to the blood circulation to await uptake by the bite of another mosquito.[38] Once inside a mosquito, the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, and eventually form daughter sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito\\'s salivary glands to be injected into a new host when the mosquito bites.[38]\\n\\nThe liver infection causes no symptoms; all symptoms of malaria result from the infection of red blood cells.[31] Symptoms develop once there are more than around 100,000 parasites per milliliter of blood.[31] Many of the symptoms associated with severe malaria are caused by the tendency of P. falciparum to bind to blood vessel walls, resulting in damage to the affected vessels and surrounding tissue. Parasites sequestered in the blood vessels of the lung contribute to respiratory failure. In the brain, they contribute to coma. In the placenta they contribute to low birthweight and preterm labor, and increase the risk of abortion and stillbirth.[31] The destruction of red blood cells during infection often results in anemia, exacerbated by reduced production of new red blood cells during infection.[31]\\n\\nOnly female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus Anopheles prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.[40] However, in Africa, due to the extensive use of bed nets, they began to bite earlier, before bed-net time.[41] Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, although this is rare.[42]\\n\\nRecurrent malaria [ edit ]\\n\\nSymptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period and the origin is parasites that survived in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.[43] Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood and the recurrence source is activated parasites which had persisted as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells.[44] Relapse commonly occurs after 8–24 weeks and is often seen in P. vivax and P. ovale infections.[9] However, relapse-like P. vivax recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. Some of them might have an extra-vascular or sequestered merozoite origin, making those recurrences recrudescences, not relapses.[45] Newly recognised, non-hypnozoite, possible contributing sources to recurrent peripheral P. vivax parasitemia are erythrocytic forms in the bone marrow and spleen.[46] P. vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.[47] Reinfection means that the parasites responsible for the past infection were eliminated from the body but a new parasite(s) was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from relapse and recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial malarial manifestations is typically attributed to treatment failure.[48] But doing this is not necessarily correct.[49] People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.[50]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPathophysiology [ edit ]\\n\\nPlasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cell (center), illustrating adhesion protein \"knobs\" Electron micrograph of a-infected red blood cell (center), illustrating adhesion protein \"knobs\"\\n\\nMalaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person\\'s skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito\\'s saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.[51]\\n\\nAfter a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.[51] The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.[52]\\n\\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.[51]\\n\\nSome P. vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years.[47] After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P. vivax infections,[47] although their existence in P. ovale is uncertain.[53]\\n\\nThe parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body\\'s immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P. falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.[54] The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria.[55] Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.[56]\\n\\nGenetic resistance [ edit ]\\n\\nAccording to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P. falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.[57][58][59]\\n\\nThe impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified haemoglobin S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the trait\\'s survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.[59][60]\\n\\nLiver dysfunction [ edit ]\\n\\nLiver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis.[61] While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.[61]\\n\\nDiagnosis [ edit ]\\n\\nThe blood film is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis.\\n\\nPlasmodium falciparum in human blood Ring-forms and gametocytes ofin human blood\\n\\nDue to the non-specific nature of malaria symptoms, diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history, then confirmed with a laboratory test to detect the presence of the parasite in the blood (parasitological test). In areas where malaria is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends clinicians suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers, or who has a current temperature above 37.5 °C without any other obvious cause.[62] Malaria should be suspected in children with signs of anemia: pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels below 8 grams per deciliter of blood.[62] In areas of the world with little to no malaria, the WHO recommends only testing people with possible exposure to malaria (typically travel to a malaria-endemic area) and unexplained fever.[62]\\n\\nMalaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Microscopy – i.e. examining Giemsa-stained blood with a light microscope – is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis.[31] Microscopists typically examine both a \"thick film\" of blood, allowing them to scan many blood cells in a short time, and a \"thin film\" of blood, allowing them to clearly see individual parasites and identify the infecting Plasmodium species.[31] Under typical field laboratory conditions, a microscopist can detect parasites when there are at least 100 parasites per microliter of blood, which is around the lower range of symptomatic infection.[62] Microscopic diagnosis is relatively resource intensive, requiring trained personnel, specific equipment, electricity, and a consistent supply of microscopy slides and stains.[62]\\n\\nIn places where microscopy is unavailable, malaria is diagnosed with RDTs, rapid antigen tests that detect parasite proteins in a fingerstick blood sample.[62] A variety of RDTs are commercially available, targeting the parasite proteins histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2, detects P. falciparum only), lactate dehydrogenase, or aldolase.[62] The HRP2 test is widely used in Africa, where P. falciparum predominates.[31] However, since HRP2 persists in the blood for up to five weeks after an infection is treated, an HRP2 test sometimes cannot distinguish whether someone currently has malaria or previously had it.[62] Additionally, some P. falciparum parasites in the Amazon region lack the HRP2 gene, complicating detection.[62] RDTs are fast and easily deployed to places without full diagnostic laboratories.[62] However they give considerably less information than microscopy, and sometimes vary in quality from producer to producer and lot to lot.[62]\\n\\nSerological tests to detect antibodies against Plasmodium from the blood have been developed, but are not used for malaria diagnosis due to their relatively poor sensitivity and specificity. Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed, but are not used clinically due to their relatively high cost, and poor specificity for active infections.[62]\\n\\nClassification [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria is classified into either \"severe\" or \"uncomplicated\" by the World Health Organization (WHO).[9] It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.[63]\\n\\nCerebral malaria is defined as a severe P. falciparum-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.[64]\\n\\nPrevention [ edit ]\\n\\nAnopheles stephensi mosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence. Anmosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.\\n\\nMethods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2022, there is one malaria vaccine for children which is licensed for use known as RTS,S.[11][10] The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high Anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite\\'s reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.[65]\\n\\nPrevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world\\'s poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.[66] In 2021, the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria.[67]\\n\\nIn areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation.[68]\\n\\nMosquito control [ edit ]\\n\\nVector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin.[69] However, there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection.[70] Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century.[71][72][73] ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease, as these interventions depend on how many people use nets, how many gaps in insecticide there are (low coverage areas), if people are not protected when outside of the home, and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides.[71] Modifications to people\\'s houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure.[71]\\n\\nWalls where indoor residual spraying of DDT has been applied. The mosquitoes remain on the wall until they fall down dead on the floor.\\n\\nInsecticide-treated nets [ edit ]\\n\\nA mosquito net in use.\\n\\nMosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.[74] Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.[75] About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007[76] and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected[77] and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.[78] Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.[79] It is recommended to hang a large \"bed net\" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.[80] ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.[81]\\n\\nIn areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates.[82] Questions remain concerning the durability of PBO on nets as the impact on mosquito mortality was not sustained after twenty washes in experimental trials.[82]\\n\\nIndoor residual spraying [ edit ]\\n\\nIndoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.[83] As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin.[84] This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use.[85] One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.[86] Communities using insecticide treated nets, in addition to indoor residual spraying with \\'non-pyrethroid-like\\' insecticides found associated reductions in malaria.[87] Additionally, the use of \\'pyrethroid-like\\' insecticides in addition to indoor residual spraying did not result in a detectable additional benefit in communities using insecticide treated nets.[87]\\n\\nHousing modifications [ edit ]\\n\\nHousing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as pyrethroids.[71][88] The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations. Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites, drainage and water supply near the home, availability of mosquito resting sites (vegetation around the home), the proximity to live stock and domestic animals, and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering.[71]\\n\\nOther mosquito control methods [ edit ]\\n\\nPeople have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, are effective in some locations.[89] Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.[90] There is a low certainty evidence that fogging may have an effect on malaria transmission.[91] Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission.[92] There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area.[93]\\n\\nMedications [ edit ]\\n\\nThere are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine, doxycycline, or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone)—are frequently used for prevention.[94] Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.[94] Areas of the world with chloroquine-sensitive malaria are uncommon.[95] Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population, however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area.[96] Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosiquito control, the proportion of people treated in the area, and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches.[96]\\n\\nThe protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).[97] The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.[98] During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother.[99] The use of preventive drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.[100]\\n\\nGiving antimalarial drugs to infants through intermittent preventive therapy can reduce the risk of having malaria infection, hospital admission, and anaemia.[101]\\n\\nMefloquine is more effective than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in preventing malaria for HIV-negative pregnant women. Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing malaria infection and reduce the risk of getting anaemia in HIV-positive women.[102] Giving sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for three or more doses as intermittent preventive therapy is superior than two doses for HIV-positive women living in malaria-endemic areas.[103]\\n\\nPrompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.[104]\\n\\nOthers [ edit ]\\n\\nCommunity participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.[105] Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.[106] Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,[107] and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.[108]\\n\\nTreatment [ edit ]\\n\\nAn advertisement for quinine as a malaria treatment from 1927.\\n\\nMalaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease.[109] While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.[110][111] Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.[112][113]\\n\\nUncomplicated malaria [ edit ]\\n\\nSimple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria.[114] Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT) is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.[75] The most effective treatment for P. falciparum infection is the use of ACT, which decreases resistance to any single drug component.[115][116] Artemether-lumefantrine (six-dose regimen) is more effective than the artemether-lumefantrine (four-dose regimen) or other regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives in treating falciparum malaria.[117][118] Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine.[119][120][121] Artemisinin-naphthoquine combination therapy showed promising results in treating falciparum malaria.[122] However, more research is needed to establish its efficacy as a reliable treatment.[123] Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in low transmission settings.[124] Atovaquone-proguanil is effective against uncomplicated falciparum with a possible failure rate of 5% to 10%; the addition of artesunate may reduce failure rate.[125] Azithromycin monotherapy or combination therapy has not shown effectiveness in treating plasmodium or vivax malaria.[126] Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may achieve less treatment failures when compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[127] There is insufficient data on chlorproguanil-dapsone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[128][129] The addition of primaquine with artemisinin-based combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 3-4 and day 8 of infection.[130] Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28. However, the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7.[131]\\n\\nInfection with P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae usually does not require hospitalisation. Treatment of P. vivax malaria requires both elimination of blood stages (using chloroquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy) and clearance of liver forms with an 8-aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine.[132][133]\\n\\nThe view that 8-aminoquinoline drugs kill parasites in the liver is the conventional one. However, there are reasons to believe that primaquine might, to a currently unknown extent, also inactivate non-circulating, extra-hepatic merozoites (clarity in this regard is expected to be forthcoming soon).[134]\\n\\nTo treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).[135][136] There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy.[137]\\n\\nSevere and complicated malaria [ edit ]\\n\\nCases of severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.[138] Severe and complicated malaria cases are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).[139]\\n\\nRecommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.[140][141] In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.[142] Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.[32] Artemisinin derivatives have the same or better efficacy than quinolones in preventing deaths in severe or complicated malaria.[143] Quinine loading dose helps to shorten the duration of fever and increases parasite clearance from the body.[144] There is no difference in effectiveness when using intrarectal quinine compared to intravenous or intramuscular quinine in treating uncomplicated/complicated falciparum malaria.[145] There is insufficient evidence for intramuscular arteether to treat severe malaria.[146] The provision of rectal artesunate before transfer to hospital may reduce the rate of death for children with severe malaria.[147] In children with malaria and concomitant hypoglycaemia, sublingual administration of glucose appears to result in better increases in blood sugar after 20 minutes when compared to oral administration, based on very limited data.[148]\\n\\nCerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.[149] There is insufficient data on whether osmotic agents such as mannitol or urea are effective in treating cerebral malaria.[150] Routine phenobarbitone in cerebral malaria is associated with fewer convulsions but possibly more deaths.[151] There is no evidence that steroids would bring treatment benefits for cerebral malaria.[152]\\n\\nManaging Cerebral Malaria\\n\\nCerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose, if the cause of the coma is in doubt, test for other locally prevalent causes of encephalopathy (bacterial, viral or fungal infection) should be carried out. In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection (e.g. tropical region) treatment can start without testing first.[30] To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done:\\n\\nPatients in coma should be given meticulous nursing care ( monitor vital signs, turn patient every 2 hours, avoid lying the patient in a wet bed etc.)\\n\\nA sterile urethral catheter should be inserted to help with urinating\\n\\nTo aspirate stomach content, a sterile nasogastric tube should be inserted.\\n\\nIn the occasion of convulsions, a slow intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is administered.[153]\\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to show that blood transfusion is useful in either reducing deaths for children with severe anaemia or in improving their haematocrit in one month.[154] There is insufficient evidence that iron chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone improve outcomes of those with malaria falciparum infection.[155]\\n\\nMonoclonal antibodies [ edit ]\\n\\nA 2022 clinical trial shows that a monoclonal antibody mAb L9LS offers protection against malaria. It binds the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP-1), essential to disease, and makes it ineffective.[156]\\n\\nResistance [ edit ]\\n\\nDrug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.[157] In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.[158][159] Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world.[160] Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.[161] Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.[162] Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,[163] and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.[164][165] Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia, and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions).[166]\\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence in unit packaged antimalarial drugs in preventing treatment failures of malaria infection. However, if supported by training of healthcare providers and patient information, there is improvement in compliance of those receiving treatment.[167]\\n\\nPrognosis [ edit ]\\n\\nWhen properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery.[168] However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.[169] In the most severe cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.[9] Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have had episodes of severe malaria.[170] Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.[171]\\n\\nDuring childhood, malaria causes anaemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria.[170] Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy.[172] Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.[170]\\n\\nEpidemiology [ edit ]\\n\\n0–0 1–2 3–54 55–325 326–679 680–949 950–1,358 Deaths due to malaria per million persons in 2012\\n\\nPast and current malaria prevalence in 2009\\n\\n[173] Relative incidence of Plasmodium species by country of origin for imported cases to non-endemic countries\\n\\nThe WHO estimates that in 2021 there were 247 million new cases of malaria resulting in 619,000 deaths.[4] Children under 5 years old are the most affected, accounting for 67% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019.[174] About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year; in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal malaria is associated with up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly.[28] There are about 10,000 malaria cases per year in Western Europe, and 1300–1500 in the United States.[24] The United States eradicated malaria as a major public health concern in 1951,[175] though small outbreaks persist.[176] About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003.[69] Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years. According to the WHO and UNICEF, deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60%[78] from a 2000 estimate of 985,000, largely due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies.[75] Efforts at decreasing the disease in Africa since 2000 have been partially effective, with rates of the disease dropping by an estimated forty percent on the continent.[177]\\n\\nMalaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur.[178] An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66).[179] A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali.[180] The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global levels of malaria, providing a way to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden.[181][182] This effort led to the publication of a map of P. falciparum endemicity in 2010 and an update in 2019.[183][184][185] As of 2021, 84 countries have endemic malaria.[4]\\n\\nThe geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other.[186] Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters where mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding.[187] In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall.[188] Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes.[189] In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.[190]\\n\\nClimate change [ edit ]\\n\\nClimate change is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain.[191] Greater rainfall in certain areas of India, and following an El Niño event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.[192]\\n\\nSince 1900 there has been substantial change in temperature and rainfall over Africa.[193] However, factors that contribute to how rainfall results in water for mosquito breeding are complex, incorporating the extent to which it is absorbed into soil and vegetation for example, or rates of runoff and evaporation.[194] Recent research has provided a more in-depth picture of conditions across Africa, combining a malaria climatic suitability model with a continental-scale model representing real-world hydrological processes.[194]\\n\\nHistory [ edit ]\\n\\nAlthough the parasite responsible for P. falciparum malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture[195] and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P. falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.[196]\\n\\nReferences to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history.[197] Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian.[198] The Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps.[198] Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire,[199] and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the \"Roman fever\".[200] Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, run-off from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.[201]\\n\\nThe term malaria originates from Mediaeval Italian: mala aria—\"bad air\", a part of miasma theory; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland.[202] The term appeared in English at least as early as 1768.[203] Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,[204] where it is no longer endemic,[205] though imported cases do occur.[206]\\n\\nMalaria is not referenced in the medical books of the Mayans or Aztecs. Despite this, antibodies against malaria have been detected in some South American mummies, indicating that some malaria strains in the Americas might have a pre-Columbian origin.[207] European settlers and the West Africans they enslaved likely brought malaria to the Americas starting in the 16th century.[208][209]\\n\\nScientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time.[210] He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a protist was identified as causing disease.[211] For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.[212] This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott,[213] and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the \"father of tropical medicine\", on the transmission of filariasis.[214]\\n\\nIn April 1894, a Scottish physician, Sir Ronald Ross, visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes.[215] He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.[215] For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius.[216] The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.[217]\\n\\nIn 1896, Amico Bignami discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria.[218] In 1898, Bignami, Giovanni Battista Grassi and Giuseppe Bastianelli succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans, using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the Accademia dei Lincei.[215]\\n\\nArtemisia annua, source of the antimalarial drug , source of the antimalarial drug artemisinin\\n\\nThe first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment.[219] It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou.[220][221]\\n\\nQuinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.[222]\\n\\nThe medicinal value of Artemisia annua has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2,000 years. In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his \"Compendium of Materia Medica\". Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua, became the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials.[223] Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong.[224] For her work on malaria, Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[225]\\n\\nPlasmodium vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis. In 1927, the inventor of this technique, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.[226]\\n\\nU.S. Marines with malaria in a field hospital on Guadalcanal , October 1942\\n\\nThe first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT.[227] Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.[85] Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water.[228]\\n\\nMalaria vaccines have been another goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been considerable progress in developing similar vaccination strategies for humans.[229] The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.[230]\\n\\nIn total, malaria may have killed 50-60 billion people throughout history, or about half of all humans that have ever lived.[231]\\n\\nNames [ edit ]\\n\\nVarious types of malaria have been called by the names below:[232]\\n\\nEradication efforts [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas, but not globally. Malaria was once common in the United States, but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs, which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.[233] The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US the 1950s, as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.[234] Most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa have also eliminated malaria.[235] The WHO defines \"elimination\" (or \"malaria-free\") as having no domestic transmission (indigenous cases) for the past three years. They also define \"pre-elimination\" and \"elimination\" stages when a country has fewer than 5 or 1, respectively, cases per 1000 people at risk per year.\\n\\nIn 1955 the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP), which supported substantial reductions in malaria cases in some countries, including India.[236] However, due to vector and parasite resistance and other factors, the feasibility of eradicating malaria with the strategy used at the time and resources available led to waning support for the program.[237] WHO suspended the program in 1969.[236][237]\\n\\n1962 Pakistani postage stamp promoting malaria eradication program\\n\\nTarget 6C of the Millennium Development Goals included reversal of the global increase in malaria incidence by 2015, with specific targets for children under 5 years old.[238] Since 2000, support for malaria eradication increased, although some actors in the global health community (including voices within the WHO) view malaria eradication as a premature goal and suggest that the establishment of strict deadlines for malaria eradication may be counterproductive as they are likely to be missed.[239]\\n\\nIn 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished. In 2007, World Malaria Day was established by the 60th session of the World Health Assembly. As of 2018, they are still functioning.[240]\\n\\nVideo recording of a set of presentations given in 2010 about humanity\\'s efforts towards malaria eradication\\n\\nAs of 2012 , The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria.[241] The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.[242] Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites.[181] The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, \"to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination\".[243] In November 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication\\'s long-term goal.[244]\\n\\nIn 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030,[245] and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040.[246] According to the WHO\\'s World Malaria Report 2015, the global mortality rate for malaria fell by 60% between 2000 and 2015. The WHO targeted a further 90% reduction between 2015 and 2030,[247] with a 40% reduction and eradication in 10 countries by 2020.[248] However, the 2020 goal was missed with a slight increase in cases compared to 2015.[249]\\n\\nBefore 2016, the Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided 659 million ITN (insecticide treated bed nets), organise support and education to prevents malaria. The challenges are high due to the lack of funds, the fragile health structure and the remote indigenous population that could be hard to reach and educate. Most of indigenous population rely on self-diagnosis, self-treatment, healer, and traditional medicine. The WHO applied for fund to the Gates Foundation which favour the action of malaria eradication in 2007.[250] Six countries, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Sri Lanka managed to have no endemic cases of malaria for three consecutive years and certified malaria-free by the WHO despite the stagnation of the funding in 2010.[238] The funding is essential to finance the cost of medication and hospitalisation cannot be supported by the poor countries where the disease is widely spread. The goal of eradication has not been met; nevertheless, the decrease rate of the disease is considerable.\\n\\nWhile 31 out of 92 endemic countries were estimated to be on track with the WHO goals for 2020, 15 countries reported an increase of 40% or more between 2015 and 2020.[249] Between 2000 and 30 June 2021, twelve countries were certified by the WHO as being malaria-free. Argentina and Algeria were declared free of malaria in 2019.[249][251] El Salvador and China were declared malaria-free in the first half of 2021.[252][253]\\n\\nRegional disparities were evident: Southeast Asia was on track to meet WHO\\'s 2020 goals, while Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions were off-track.[249] The six Greater Mekong Subregion countries aim for elimination of P. falciparum transmitted malaria by 2025 and elimination of all malaria by 2030, having achieved a 97% and 90% reduction of cases respectively since 2000.[249] Ahead of World Malaria Day, 25 April 2021, WHO named 25 countries in which it is working to eliminate malaria by 2025 as part of its E-2025 initiative.[254]\\n\\nA major challenge to malaria elimination is the persistence of malaria in border regions, making international cooperation crucial.[255]\\n\\nOne of the targets of Goal 3 of the UN\\'s Sustainable Development Goals is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030.\\n\\nIn 2018, WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria, after a national malaria eradication effort that began in 1950.[256]\\n\\nAs of 2019, the eradication process is ongoing, but it will be difficult to achieve a world free of malaria with the current approaches and tools. Only one malaria vaccine is licensed for use, and it shows relatively low effectiveness, while several other vaccine candidates in clinical trials[11] aim to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of malaria transmission. Approaches may require investing more in research and greater primary health care.[257] Continuing surveillance will also be important to prevent the return of malaria in countries where the disease has been eliminated.[258]\\n\\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\\n\\nEconomic impact [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria clinic in Tanzania\\n\\nMalaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development.[16][17] Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria\\'s furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.[259]\\n\\nA comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted for parity of purchasing power, between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.[260]\\n\\nPoverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.[18] The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.[261]\\n\\nChild with malaria in Ethiopia\\n\\nCerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.[172] Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.[170] Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.[262]\\n\\nCounterfeit and substandard drugs [ edit ]\\n\\nSophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia,[263] China,[264] Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are a major cause of avoidable death in those countries.[265] The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries.[266] There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.[267]\\n\\nAnother clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.[268] A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.[269]\\n\\nWar [ edit ]\\n\\nWorld War II poster\\n\\nThroughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.[270] In 1910, Nobel Prize in Medicine-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled The Prevention of Malaria that included a chapter titled \"The Prevention of Malaria in War\". The chapter\\'s author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: \"The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era. ... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.\"[271] In British-occupied India the cocktail gin and tonic may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.[272]\\n\\nMalaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected.[273] According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \"Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.\"[274]\\n\\nSignificant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents. During World War I and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines. American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces.[275]\\n\\nAdditionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA \"was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic\".[276]\\n\\nResearch [ edit ]\\n\\nThe Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&D) must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria.[277][278]\\n\\nVaccine [ edit ]\\n\\nA vaccine against malaria called RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) was approved by European regulators in 2015.[230] As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – as part of the WHO\\'s Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).[279]\\n\\nImmunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P. falciparum malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.[50][280] An individual can be protected from a P. falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation.[281] The highly polymorphic nature of many P. falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.[282] Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite\\'s life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.[283] For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.[284]\\n\\nIn 2021, researchers from the University of Oxford reported findings from a Phase IIb trial of a candidate malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which demonstrated efficacy of 77% over 12-months of follow-up. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization\\'s Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy.[285]\\n\\nMedications [ edit ]\\n\\nMalaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles related to the plastids found in plants, complete with their own genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs.[286]\\n\\nWith the onset of drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins.[287][288] Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.[289][290]\\n\\n(+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called spiroindolone. It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells. This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model. As of 2014, a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. [291]\\n\\nNITD246 and NITD609: Also belonged to the class of spiroindolone and target the ATP4 protein.[291]\\n\\nOn the basis of molecular docking outcomes, compounds 3j, 4b, 4h, 4m were exhibited selectivity towards PfLDH. The post docking analysis displayed stable dynamic behavior of all the selected compounds compared to Chloroquine. The end state thermodynamics analysis stated 3j compound as a selective and potent PfLDH inhibitor.[292]\\n\\nNew targets [ edit ]\\n\\nTargeting Plasmodium liver-stage parasites selectively is emerging as an alternative strategy in the face of resistance to the latest frontline combination therapies against blood stages of the parasite.[293]\\n\\nIn a research conducted in 2019, using experimental analysis with knockout (KO) mutants of Plasmodium berguei the authors were able to identify genes that are potentially essential in the liver stage. Moreover, they generated a computational model to analyse pre–erytrocytic development and liver–stage metabolism. Combining both methods they identified seven metabolic subsystems that become essential compared to the blood stage. Some of these metabolic pathways are fatty acid synthesis and elongation, tricarboxylic acid, amino acid and heme metabolism among others.[293]\\n\\nSpecifically, they studied 3 subsystems: fatty acid synthesis and elongation, and amino sugar biosynthesis. For the first two pathways they demonstrated a clear dependence of the liver stage on its own fatty acid metabolism.[293]\\n\\nThey proved for the first time the critical role of amino sugar biosynthesis in the liver stage of P. berghei. The uptake of N–acetyl–glucosamine appears to be limited in the liver stage, being its synthesis needed for the parasite development.[293]\\n\\nThese findings and the computational model provide a basis for the design of antimalarial therapies targeting metabolic proteins.[293][294]\\n\\nOther [ edit ]\\n\\nA non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.[74]\\n\\nGenomics is central to malaria research. With the sequencing of P. falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied.[295] Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.[296]\\n\\nIn one study, a genetically modified strain of Anopheles stephensi was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.[297]\\n\\nGene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria,[298] zika,[299] dengue and yellow fever).[245]\\n\\nIn December 2020, a review article found that malaria-endemic regions had lower reported COVID-19 case fatality rates on average than regions where malaria was not known to be endemic.[300]\\n\\nAdditionally, research conducted in 2015 demonstrated that in mice, malaria co-infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a pulmonary migrating helminth, has dampened the virulence of the Plasmodium parasite.[301] Researchers demonstrated bottom-up control of malaria infection by the nematode; specifically, nematode infection leads to increased destruction of erythrocytes. It is known that Plasmodium prefers older host erythrocytes, which are easier for it to infect, so increased destruction, causing subsequent increased erythropoiesis, leads to an overall younger erythrocyte population resulting in a decrease in Plasmodium population.[301] Interestingly, this disease control is largely independent of host immune control of Plasmodium, and may provide interesting insights for future treatment.[301]\\n\\nOther animals [ edit ]\\n\\nWhile there are no animal reservoirs for the strains of malaria that cause human infections,[302] nearly 200 parasitic Plasmodium species have been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals,[303] and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates.[304] Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P. coatneyi (a model for P. falciparum) and P. cynomolgi (P. vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans.[305] Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P. berghei.[306] Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P. relictum is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.[307]\\n\\nReferences [ edit ]\\n\\nCitations [ edit ]\\n\\nSources [ edit ]\\n\\nFurther reading [ edit ]Group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth and spread\\n\\nThis article is about the group of diseases. For other uses, see Cancer (disambiguation)\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nCancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][7] These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread.[7] Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements.[1] While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes.[1] Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.[7]\\n\\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.[2] Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol.[2][8][9] Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants.[3] In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[2] These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell.[10] Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[10] Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects.[11] Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.[2] It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.[12]\\n\\nThe risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, eating resistant starch,[13][14] vaccination against certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption of processed meat and red meat, and limiting exposure to direct sunlight.[15][16] Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer.[17] The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial.[17][18] Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.[2][4] Pain and symptom management are an important part of care.[2] Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease.[2] The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.[10] In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%.[19] For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66% for all ages.[5]\\n\\nIn 2015, about 90.5 million people worldwide had cancer.[20] In 2019, annual cancer cases grew by 23.6 million people and there were 10 million deaths worldwide, representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21%, respectively.[6][21]\\n\\nThe most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer.[22] In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer.[10] If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases.[23][24] In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa, where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often.[19] In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer.[22] The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries.[10] Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.[25] The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated at US$1.16 trillion (equivalent to $1.56 trillion in 2022) per year as of 2010 .[26]\\n\\nEtymology and definitions\\n\\nThe word comes from the ancient Greek καρκίνος, meaning \\'crab\\' and \\'tumor\\'. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted the similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins. The word was introduced in English in the modern medical sense around 1600.[27]\\n\\nCancers comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][7] They form a subset of neoplasms. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.[28][29]\\n\\nAll tumor cells show the six hallmarks of cancer. These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:[30]\\n\\nThe progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.[30][31]\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of cancer metastasis depend on the location of the tumor.\\n\\nWhen cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates. The findings that result depend on cancer\\'s type and location. Few symptoms are specific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a \"great imitator.\"[32]\\n\\nPeople may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.[33]\\n\\nLocal symptoms\\n\\nLocal symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps. Ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood (lung cancer), anemia or rectal bleeding (colon cancer), blood in the urine (bladder cancer), or abnormal vaginal bleeding (endometrial or cervical cancer). Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen.[32]\\n\\nSystemic symptoms\\n\\nSystemic symptoms may occur due to the body\\'s response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes.[34] Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as cachexia.[35]\\n\\nSome cancers, such as Hodgkin\\'s disease, leukemias, and liver or kidney cancers, can cause a persistent fever.[32]\\n\\nSome systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as paraneoplastic syndromes. Common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, or hyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures.[36]\\n\\nMetastasis\\n\\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.[37] Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.[38]\\n\\nMetastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones.[37]\\n\\nCauses\\n\\n[39] Share of cancer deaths attributed to tobacco in 2016.\\n\\nThe majority of cancers, some 90–95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors.[3] The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics.[3] Environmental refers to any cause that is not inherited, such as lifestyle, economic, and behavioral factors and not merely pollution.[40] Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco use (25–30%), diet and obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of physical activity, and pollution.[3][41] Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for the onset of cancer,[42][43] though it may worsen outcomes in those who already have cancer.[42]\\n\\nIt is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons. Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease,[44] however factors that may have contributed to the development of cancer can be transmissible; such as oncoviruses like hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus and HIV.\\n\\nChemicals\\n\\nThe incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking.\\n\\nExposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer. These substances are called carcinogens.\\n\\nTobacco smoke, for example, causes 90% of lung cancer.[45] It also causes cancer in the larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas.[46] Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.[47]\\n\\nTobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide[47] and about one in three in the developed world.[48] Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990.[49][50]\\n\\nIn Western Europe, 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers.[51] Cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases,[52] causing at least 200,000 deaths.[53] Cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers, or leukemia from exposure to benzene.[53]\\n\\nExposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is predominantly used in the production of Teflon, is known to cause two kinds of cancer.[54][55]\\n\\nDiet and exercise\\n\\nDiet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths.[3][56] In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths.[56] A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country.[57] Physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk, not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system.[56] More than half of the effect from the diet is due to overnutrition (eating too much), rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods.\\n\\nSome specific foods are linked to specific cancers. A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer.[58] Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, causes liver cancer.[58] Betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer.[58] National differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet[59] while colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrant cancer profiles mirror those of their new country, often within one generation.[60]\\n\\nInfection\\n\\nWorldwide approximately 18% of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases.[3] This proportion ranges from a high of 25% in Africa to less than 10% in the developed world.[3] Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also play a role.\\n\\nOncoviruses (viruses that can cause cancer) include human papillomavirus (cervical cancer), Epstein–Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi\\'s sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma) and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias). Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.[61][62] Parasitic infections associated with cancer include Schistosoma haematobium (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis (cholangiocarcinoma).[63]\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\nRadiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer.[64][65][66] Many non-melanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight.[65] Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas.[65]\\n\\nIonizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.[67] Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.[67] Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke.[67] Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age. Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect.[67]\\n\\nMedical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers. Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer.[67] It is also used in some kinds of medical imaging.[68]\\n\\nProlonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies.[69] Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world.[69]\\n\\nNon-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones, electric power transmission and other similar sources has been described as a possible carcinogen by the World Health Organization\\'s International Agency for Research on Cancer.[70] Evidence, however, has not supported a concern.[71] [64] This includes that studies have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk.[72]\\n\\nHeredity\\n\\nThe vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary (sporadic). Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. Less than 0.3% of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than 3–10% of cancer.[73] Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer,[73] and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome), which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer,[74] among others.\\n\\nStatistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has been diagnosed with it is about 2.[75] The corresponding relative risk is 1.5 for lung cancer,[76] and 1.9 for prostate cancer.[77] For breast cancer, the relative risk is 1.8 with a first-degree relative having developed it at 50 years of age or older, and 3.3 when the relative developed it when being younger than 50 years of age.[78]\\n\\nTaller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than shorter people. Since height is genetically determined to a large extent, taller people have a heritable increase of cancer risk.[79]\\n\\nPhysical agents\\n\\nSome substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects.[80] A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma (cancer of the serous membrane) usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs.[80] Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers, such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects.[80] Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite and tridymite).[80] Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhalation) and require years of exposure to produce cancer.[80]\\n\\nPhysical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare.[81] Claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer, for example, have not been proven.[81] Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer or brain cancer.[81] One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body. It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters (charcoal hand warmers), may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.[81] Frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.[81] Generally, it is believed that cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of healing, rather than directly by the trauma.[81] However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation.\\n\\nChronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation.[81][82] Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor microenvironment.[83][84] Oncogenes build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.[85]\\n\\nHormones\\n\\nSome hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.[86] Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis.[87]\\n\\nHormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.[86] For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer. These higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.[86] Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer.[86] Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer.[86]\\n\\nOther factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.[86] Women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones.[86] On the other hand, people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer.[86] Osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones.[86] Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers.[86]\\n\\nAutoimmune diseases\\n\\nThere is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment, probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies.[88] Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with Crohn\\'s disease and ulcerative colitis, due to chronic inflammation. Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extra-intestinal malignancies.[89]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nCancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat.\\n\\nGenetics\\n\\nCancer is fundamentally a disease of tissue growth regulation. For a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered.[90]\\n\\nThe affected genes are divided into two broad categories. Oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival. Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes. Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.[91]\\n\\nGenetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms. The gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis. More common are mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA.\\n\\nLarge-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.\\n\\nSmall-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene\\'s coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, leading to the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.\\n\\nReplication of the data contained within the DNA of living cells will probabilistically result in some errors (mutations). Complex error correction and prevention are built into the process and safeguard the cell against cancer. If a significant error occurs, the damaged cell can self-destruct through programmed cell death, termed apoptosis. If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells.\\n\\nSome environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate. Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation, or hypoxia.[92]\\n\\nThe errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding, for example:\\n\\nA mutation in the error-correcting machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly.\\n\\nA further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts.\\n\\nA further mutation may cause loss of a tumor suppressor gene, disrupting the apoptosis signaling pathway and immortalizing the cell.\\n\\nA further mutation in the signaling machinery of the cell might send error-causing signals to nearby cells.\\n\\nThe transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth. This rebellion-like scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest, where the driving forces of evolution work against the body\\'s design and enforcement of order. Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed clonal evolution, drives progression towards more invasive stages.[93] Clonal evolution leads to intra-tumour heterogeneity (cancer cells with heterogeneous mutations) that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment.\\n\\nCharacteristic abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories, specifically evasion of apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction.[30][31]\\n\\nEpigenetics\\n\\nThe central role of DNA damage and epigenetic defects in DNA repair genes in carcinogenesis\\n\\nThe classical view of cancer is a set of diseases driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and in chromosomal abnormalities. A role for epigenetic alterations was identified in the early 21st century.[94]\\n\\nEpigenetic alterations are functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation), histone modification[95] and changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as HMGA2 or HMGA1).[96] Each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes may remain through cell divisions, endure for multiple generations, and can be considered as equivalent to mutations.\\n\\nEpigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers. As an example, one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer. These included 147 hypermethylated and 27 hypomethylated genes. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.[97]\\n\\nWhile epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, may be of particular importance. Such alterations may occur early in progression to cancer and are a possible cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers.[98][99][100]\\n\\nReduced expression of DNA repair genes disrupts DNA repair. This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top. (In the figure, red wording indicates the central role of DNA damage and defects in DNA repair in progression to cancer.) When DNA repair is deficient DNA damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level (5th level) and causes increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation (6th level). Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair[101][102] or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR).[103] Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.[104]\\n\\nHigher levels of DNA damage cause increased mutation (right side of figure) and increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damage, incompletely cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene silencing.[105][106]\\n\\nDeficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) have increased cancer risk, with some defects ensuring a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations).[107] Germ line DNA repair mutations are noted on the figure\\'s left side. However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.[108]\\n\\nIn sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level. Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity. In addition, frequent epigenetic alterations of the DNA sequences code for small RNAs called microRNAs (or miRNAs). miRNAs do not code for proteins, but can \"target\" protein-coding genes and reduce their expression.\\n\\nCancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion (see Field defects in progression to cancer). Mutations, however, may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations. An average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein-altering mutations, of which about three or four may be \"driver\" mutations and the remaining ones may be \"passenger\" mutations.[109]\\n\\nMetastasis\\n\\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.[37] Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.[38]\\n\\nMetastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both. The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis. Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain and the bones.[37]\\n\\nMetabolism\\n\\nNormal cells typically generate only about 30% of energy from glycolysis,[110] whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect).[111][112][113] But a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, including lymphoma, leukemia, and endometrial cancer.[114] Even in these cases, however, the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%.[110] A few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide (DNA, RNA) synthesis.[115][110] Cancer stem cells often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source.[116]\\n\\nSeveral studies have indicated that the enzyme sirtuin 6 is selectively inactivated during oncogenesis in a variety of tumor types by inducing glycolysis.[113] Another sirtuin, sirtuin 3 inhibits cancers that depend upon glycolysis, but promotes cancers that depend upon oxidative phosphorylation.[117]\\n\\nA low-carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) has sometimes been recommended as a supportive therapy for cancer treatment.[118][119]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nChest X-ray showing lung cancer in the left lung\\n\\nMost cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening.[120] Neither of these leads to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These commonly include blood tests, X-rays, (contrast) CT scans and endoscopy.\\n\\nThe tissue diagnosis from the biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its histological grade, genetic abnormalities and other features. Together, this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis and to choose the best treatment.\\n\\nCytogenetics and immunohistochemistry are other types of tissue tests. These tests provide information about molecular changes (such as mutations, fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes) and may thus also indicate the prognosis and best treatment.\\n\\nCancer diagnosis can cause psychological distress and psychosocial interventions, such as talking therapy, may help people with this.[121]\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nCancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor. These types include:\\n\\nCancers are usually named using -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as a suffix, with the Latin or Greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root. For example, cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called hepatocarcinoma, while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a liposarcoma. For some common cancers, the English organ name is used. For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast. Here, the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts.\\n\\nBenign tumors (which are not cancers) are named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma (the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid). Confusingly, some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma.\\n\\nSome types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\n[123] Global deaths from cancers attributable to risk factors in 2019 by sex and .\\n\\n[123] Cancer DALYs attributable to 11 Level 2 risk factors globally in 2019.\\n\\nCancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk.[124] The vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors. Many of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices. Thus, cancer is generally preventable.[125] Between 70% and 90% of common cancers are due to environmental factors and therefore potentially preventable.[126]\\n\\nGreater than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including: tobacco, excess weight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections and air pollution.[127] Further, poverty could be considered as an indirect risk factor in human cancers.[128] Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation and cancers caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus are not preventable via personal behavior.\\n\\nIn 2019, ~44% of all cancer deaths – or ~4.5 M deaths or ~105 million lost disability-adjusted life years – were due to known clearly preventable risk factors, led by smoking, alcohol use and high BMI, according to a GBD systematic analysis.[123]\\n\\nDietary\\n\\nWhile many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce cancer risks, the evidence to support them is not definitive.[15][129] The primary dietary factors that increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption. Diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat have been implicated but reviews and meta-analyses do not come to a consistent conclusion.[130][131] A 2014 meta-analysis found no relationship between fruits and vegetables and cancer.[132] Coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer.[133] Studies have linked excessive consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer, a phenomenon that could be due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures.[134][135] In 2015 the IARC reported that eating processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) and, to a lesser degree, red meat was linked to some cancers.[136][137]\\n\\nDietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods and refined carbohydrates.[15][129]\\n\\nMedication\\n\\nMedications can be used to prevent cancer in a few circumstances.[138] In the general population, NSAIDs reduce the risk of colorectal cancer; however, due to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, they cause overall harm when used for prevention.[139] Aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about 7%.[140] COX-2 inhibitors may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis; however, it is associated with the same adverse effects as NSAIDs.[141] Daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women.[142] The benefit versus harm for 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear.[143]\\n\\nVitamin supplementation does not appear to be effective at preventing cancer.[144] While low blood levels of vitamin D are correlated with increased cancer risk,[145][146][147] whether this relationship is causal and vitamin D supplementation is protective is not determined.[148][149] One 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk.[149] Another 2014 review concluded that vitamin D 3 may decrease the risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people treated over 5 years), but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.[150]\\n\\nBeta-Carotene supplementation increases lung cancer rates in those who are high risk.[151] Folic acid supplementation is not effective in preventing colon cancer and may increase colon polyps.[152] Selenium supplementation has not been shown to reduce the risk of cancer.[153]\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nVaccines have been developed that prevent infection by some carcinogenic viruses.[154] Human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer.[154] The hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis B virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer.[154] The administration of human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccinations is recommended where resources allow.[155]\\n\\nScreening\\n\\nUnlike diagnostic efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs, cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear.[156] This may involve physical examination, blood or urine tests or medical imaging.[156]\\n\\nCancer screening is not available for many types of cancers. Even when tests are available, they may not be recommended for everyone. Universal screening or mass screening involves screening everyone.[157] Selective screening identifies people who are at higher risk, such as people with a family history.[157] Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.[156] These factors include:\\n\\nPossible harms from the screening test: for example, X-ray images involve exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation\\n\\nThe likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer\\n\\nThe likelihood that cancer is present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers.\\n\\nPossible harms from follow-up procedures\\n\\nWhether suitable treatment is available\\n\\nWhether early detection improves treatment outcomes\\n\\nWhether cancer will ever need treatment\\n\\nWhether the test is acceptable to the people: If a screening test is too burdensome (for example, extremely painful), then people will refuse to participate. [157]\\n\\nCost\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force\\n\\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues recommendations for various cancers:\\n\\nJapan\\n\\nScreens for gastric cancer using photofluorography due to the high incidence there.[25]\\n\\nGenetic testing\\n\\nGene Cancer types BRCA1, BRCA2 Breast, ovarian, pancreatic HNPCC, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, PMS2 Colon, uterine, small bowel, stomach, urinary tract\\n\\nGenetic testing for individuals at high-risk of certain cancers is recommended by unofficial groups.[155][171] Carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk.[171]\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nMany treatment options for cancer exist. The primary ones include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and palliative care. Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the patient\\'s health and preferences. The treatment intent may or may not be curative.\\n\\nChemotherapy\\n\\nChemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic anti-neoplastic drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized regimen. The term encompasses a variety of drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and antimetabolites.[172] Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, a critical property of most cancer cells.\\n\\nIt was found that providing combined cytotoxic drugs is better than a single drug, a process called the combination therapy, which has an advantage in the statistics of survival and response to the tumor and in the progress of the disease.[173] A Cochrane review concluded that combined therapy was more effective to treat metastasized breast cancer. However, generally it is not certain whether combination chemotherapy leads to better health outcomes, when both survival and toxicity are considered.[174]\\n\\nTargeted therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells. The first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer. Another common example is the class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).[4] Currently, targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and thyroid cancer as well as other cancer types.[175]\\n\\nThe efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. In combination with surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers.[176] Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias,[177][178] ineffective in some brain tumors,[179] and needless in others, such as most non-melanoma skin cancers.[180] The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by its toxicity to other tissues in the body. Even when chemotherapy does not provide a permanent cure, it may be useful to reduce symptoms such as pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will become possible in the future.\\n\\nRadiation\\n\\nRadiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve symptoms. It works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue, causing mitotic catastrophe resulting in the death of the cancer cells. [181] To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs, which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from multiple exposure angles to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. As with chemotherapy, cancers vary in their response to radiation therapy.[182][183][184]\\n\\nRadiation therapy is used in about half of cases. The radiation can be either from internal sources (brachytherapy) or external sources. The radiation is most commonly low energy X-rays for treating skin cancers, while higher energy X-rays are used for cancers within the body.[185] Radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy. For certain types of cancer, such as early head and neck cancer, it may be used alone.[186] For painful bone metastasis, it has been found to be effective in about 70% of patients.[186]\\n\\nSurgery\\n\\nSurgery is the primary method of treatment for most isolated, solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival. It is typically an important part of definitive diagnosis and staging of tumors, as biopsies are usually required. In localized cancer, surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with, in certain cases, the lymph nodes in the area. For some types of cancer this is sufficient to eliminate the cancer.[176]\\n\\nPalliative care\\n\\nPalliative care is treatment that attempts to help the patient feel better and may be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer. Palliative care includes action to reduce physical, emotional, spiritual and psycho-social distress. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life.\\n\\nPeople at all stages of cancer treatment typically receive some kind of palliative care. In some cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care.[187] This applies to patients who:[188]\\n\\ndisplay low performance status, implying limited ability to care for themselves[187] received no benefit from prior evidence-based treatments[187] are not eligible to participate in any appropriate clinical trial[187] no strong evidence implies that treatment would be effective[187]\\n\\nPalliative care may be confused with hospice and therefore only indicated when people approach end of life. Like hospice care, palliative care attempts to help the patient cope with their immediate needs and to increase comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at the cancer.\\n\\nMultiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for patients whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms or who need help coping with their illness. In patients first diagnosed with metastatic disease, palliative care may be immediately indicated. Palliative care is indicated for patients with a prognosis of less than 12 months of life even given aggressive treatment.[189][190][191]\\n\\nImmunotherapy\\n\\nA variety of therapies using immunotherapy, stimulating or helping the immune system to fight cancer, have come into use since 1997. Approaches include antibodies, checkpoint therapy, and adoptive cell transfer.[192]\\n\\nLaser therapy\\n\\nLaser therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths. Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer. It is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT), or interstitial laser photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is surgeons must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.[193]\\n\\nAlternative medicine\\n\\nComplementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of therapies, practices and products that are not part of conventional medicine.[194] \"Complementary medicine\" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while \"alternative medicine\" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.[195] Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been studied or tested using conventional techniques such as clinical trials. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers stated, \"The label \\'unproven\\' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been \\'disproven\\'.\"[196]\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\n[197] Three measures of global cancer mortality from 1990 to 2017\\n\\nSurvival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis. Once a cancer has metastasized, prognosis normally becomes much worse. About half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from that cancer or its treatment.[25] A majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary tumor.[198]\\n\\nSurvival is worse in the developing world,[25] partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with developed countries.[199]\\n\\nThose who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed.[200] The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer (particularly radiation therapy), and better compliance with screening.[200]\\n\\nPredicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors. The most important are the cancer type and the patient\\'s age and overall health. Those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people. Centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful. People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.[201] People with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report poorer quality of life because they perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal.\\n\\nPeople with cancer have an increased risk of blood clots in their veins which can be life-threatening.[202] The use of blood thinners such as heparin decrease the risk of blood clots but have not been shown to increase survival in people with cancer.[202] People who take blood thinners also have an increased risk of bleeding.[202]\\n\\nAlthough extremely rare, some forms of cancer, even from an advanced stage, can heal spontaneously. This phenomenon is known as the spontaneous remission.[203]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nSee or edit source data. [204] Age-standardized death rate from cancer per 10,000 people.\\n\\nEstimates are that in 2018, 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million deaths occur globally.[205] About 20% of males and 17% of females will get cancer at some point in time while 13% of males and 9% of females will die from it.[205]\\n\\nIn 2008, approximately 12.7 million cancers were diagnosed (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers and other non-invasive cancers)[25] and in 2010 nearly 7.98 million people died.[206] Cancers account for approximately 16% of deaths. The most common as of 2018 are lung cancer (1.76 million deaths), colorectal cancer (860,000) stomach cancer (780,000), liver cancer (780,000), and breast cancer (620,000).[2] This makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading in the developing world.[25] Over half of cases occur in the developing world.[25]\\n\\nDeaths from cancer were 5.8 million in 1990.[206] Deaths have been increasing primarily due to longer lifespans and lifestyle changes in the developing world.[25] The most significant risk factor for developing cancer is age.[207] Although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age, most patients with invasive cancer are over 65.[207] According to cancer researcher Robert A. Weinberg, \"If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer.\"[208] Some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to immunosenescence,[209] errors accumulated in DNA over a lifetime[210] and age-related changes in the endocrine system.[211] Aging\\'s effect on cancer is complicated by factors such as DNA damage and inflammation promoting it and factors such as vascular aging and endocrine changes inhibiting it.[212]\\n\\nSome slow-growing cancers are particularly common, but often are not fatal. Autopsy studies in Europe and Asia showed that up to 36% of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths and that 80% of men develop prostate cancer by age 80.[213][214] As these cancers do not cause the patient\\'s death, identifying them would have represented overdiagnosis rather than useful medical care.\\n\\nThe three most common childhood cancers are leukemia (34%), brain tumors (23%) and lymphomas (12%).[215] In the United States cancer affects about 1 in 285 children.[216] Rates of childhood cancer increased by 0.6% per year between 1975 and 2002 in the United States[217] and by 1.1% per year between 1978 and 1997 in Europe.[215] Death from childhood cancer decreased by half between 1975 and 2010 in the United States.[216]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nEngraving with two views of a Dutch woman who had a tumor removed from her neck in 1689\\n\\nCancer has existed for all of human history.[218] The earliest written record regarding cancer is from circa 1600 BC in the Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus and describes breast cancer.[218] Hippocrates ( c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them with the Greek word καρκίνος karkinos (crab or crayfish).[218] This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor, with \"the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name\".[219] Galen stated that \"cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins\".[220]: 738 Celsus ( c. 25 BC – 50 AD) translated karkinos into the Latin cancer, also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment.[218] Galen (2nd century AD) disagreed with the use of surgery and recommended purgatives instead.[218] These recommendations largely stood for 1000 years.[218]\\n\\nIn the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, it became acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death.[221] The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and concluded that it was contagious.[222]\\n\\nThe physician John Hill described tobacco sniffing as the cause of nose cancer in 1761.[221] This was followed by the report in 1775 by British surgeon Percivall Pott that chimney sweeps\\' carcinoma, a cancer of the scrotum, was a common disease among chimney sweeps.[223] With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the \\'cancer poison\\' spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (\"metastasis\"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874.[224]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nAlthough many diseases (such as heart failure) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos. The euphemism of \"a long illness\" to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries, rather than naming the disease explicitly, reflecting an apparent stigma.[225] Cancer is also euphemised as \"the C-word\";[226][227][228] Macmillan Cancer Support uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease.[229] In Nigeria, one local name for cancer translates into English as \"the disease that cannot be cured\".[230] This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma skin cancers, accounting for about one-third of cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths[231][232]—are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure.[233]\\n\\nWestern conceptions of patients\\' rights for people with cancer include a duty to fully disclose the medical situation to the person, and the right to engage in shared decision-making in a way that respects the person\\'s own values. In other cultures, other rights and values are preferred. For example, most African cultures value whole families rather than individualism. In parts of Africa, a diagnosis is commonly made so late that cure is not possible, and treatment, if available at all, would quickly bankrupt the family. As a result of these factors, African healthcare providers tend to let family members decide whether, when and how to disclose the diagnosis, and they tend to do so slowly and circuitously, as the person shows interest and an ability to cope with the grim news.[230] People from Asian and South American countries also tend to prefer a slower, less candid approach to disclosure than is idealized in the United States and Western Europe, and they believe that sometimes it would be preferable not to be told about a cancer diagnosis.[230] In general, disclosure of the diagnosis is more common than it was in the 20th century, but full disclosure of the prognosis is not offered to many patients around the world.[230]\\n\\nIn the United States and some other cultures, cancer is regarded as a disease that must be \"fought\" to end the \"civil insurrection\"; a War on Cancer was declared in the US. Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer\\'s human effects, and they emphasize both the state of the patient\\'s health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself rather than to delay, to ignore or to rely entirely on others. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments.[234][235]\\n\\nIn the 1970s, a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment in the US was a specialized form of talk therapy, based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude.[236] People with a \"cancer personality\"—depressed, repressed, self-loathing and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire. Some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient\\'s outlook on life would cure the cancer.[236] Among other effects, this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer (by \"wanting\" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless and loving person).[237] It also increased patients\\' anxiety, as they incorrectly believed that natural emotions of sadness, anger or fear shorten their lives.[237] The idea was ridiculed by Susan Sontag, who published Illness as Metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978.[236] Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival.[237] This notion is particularly strong in breast cancer culture.[237]\\n\\nOne idea about why people with cancer are blamed or stigmatized, called the just-world hypothesis, is that blaming cancer on the patient\\'s actions or attitudes allows the blamers to regain a sense of control. This is based upon the blamers\\' belief that the world is fundamentally just and so any dangerous illness, like cancer, must be a type of punishment for bad choices, because in a just world, bad things would not happen to good people.[238]\\n\\nEconomic effect\\n\\nThe total health care expenditure on cancer in the US was estimated to be $80.2 billion in 2015.[239] Even though cancer-related health care expenditure have increased in absolute terms during recent decades, the share of health expenditure devoted to cancer treatment has remained close to 5% between the 1960s and 2004.[240][241] A similar pattern has been observed in Europe where about 6% of all health care expenditure are spent on cancer treatment.[242][243] In addition to health care expenditure and financial toxicity, cancer causes indirect costs in the form of productivity losses due to sick days, permanent incapacity and disability as well as premature death during working age. Cancer causes also costs for informal care. Indirect costs and informal care costs are typically estimated to exceed or equal the health care costs of cancer.[244][243]\\n\\nWorkplace\\n\\nIn the United States, cancer is included as a protected condition by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), mainly due to the potential for cancer having discriminating effects on workers.[245] Discrimination in the workplace could occur if an employer holds a false belief that a person with cancer is not capable of doing a job properly, and may ask for more sick leave than other employees. Employers may also make hiring or firing decisions based on misconceptions about cancer disabilities, if present. The EEOC provides interview guidelines for employers, as well as lists of possible solutions for assessing and accommodating employees with cancer.[245]\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nBecause cancer is a class of diseases,[246][247] it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \"cure for cancer\" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases.[248] Angiogenesis inhibitors were once incorrectly thought to have potential as a \"silver bullet\" treatment applicable to many types of cancer.[249] Angiogenesis inhibitors and other cancer therapeutics are used in combination to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality.[250]\\n\\nExperimental cancer treatments are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment. Treatments that succeeded in one cancer type can be tested against other types.[251] Diagnostic tests are under development to better target the right therapies to the right patients, based on their individual biology.[252]\\n\\nCancer research focuses on the following issues:\\n\\nAgents (e.g. viruses) and events (e.g. mutations) that cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer.\\n\\nThe precise nature of the genetic damage and the genes that are affected by it.\\n\\nThe consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell, both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell and in facilitating additional genetic events that lead to further progression of the cancer.\\n\\nThe improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since US President Richard Nixon declared the \"War on Cancer\" in 1971. Since then, the country has spent over $200 billion on cancer research, including resources from public and private sectors.[253] The cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) declined by five percent between 1950 and 2005.[254]\\n\\nCompetition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries, unduly favoring low-risk research into small incremental advancements over riskier, more innovative research. Other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities.[255][256][257][258]\\n\\nVirotherapy, which uses convert viruses, is being studied.\\n\\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a worry that cancer research and treatment are slowing down.[259][260]\\n\\nPregnancy\\n\\nCancer affects approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnant women. The most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non-pregnant women during childbearing ages: breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.[261]\\n\\nDiagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy. As a result, cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average. Some imaging procedures, such as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), CT scans, ultrasounds and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy; some others, such as PET scans, are not.[261]\\n\\nTreatment is generally the same as for non-pregnant women. However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries are often used to advance the start of treatment. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths).[261]\\n\\nElective abortions are not required and, for the most common forms and stages of cancer, do not improve the mother\\'s survival. In a few instances, such as advanced uterine cancer, the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others, the patient may end the pregnancy so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy.[261]\\n\\nSome treatments can interfere with the mother\\'s ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed.[261] Cervical cancer may require birth by Caesarean section. Radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis. Also, when chemotherapy is given after birth, many of the drugs appear in breast milk, which could harm the baby.[261]\\n\\nOther animals\\n\\nCancerTreeMammal\\n\\nVeterinary oncology, concentrating mainly on cats and dogs, is a growing specialty in wealthy countries and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered. The most common types of cancer differ, but the cancer burden seems at least as high in pets as in humans. Animals, typically rodents, are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human cancer.[262]\\n\\nAcross wild animals, there is still limited data on cancer. Nonetheless, a study published in 2022, explored cancer risk in (non-domesticated) zoo mammals, belonging to 191 species, 110,148 individual, demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny.[263] This research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals. For instance, species in the order Carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer (e.g. over 25% of clouded leopards, bat-eared foxes and red wolves die of cancer), while ungulates (especially even-toed ungulates) appear to face consistently low cancer risks.\\n\\nIn non-humans, a few types of transmissible cancer have also been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves. This phenomenon is seen in dogs with Sticker\\'s sarcoma (also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor), and in Tasmanian devils with devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).[264]\\n\\nReferencesBacterial infection of the small intestine\\n\\nThis article is about the bacterial disease. For the dish, see Cholera (food)\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nCholera ( ) is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.[4][3] Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.[3] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days.[2] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[3] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[2] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[5] Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish.[8] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[3]\\n\\nCholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others.[2] It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria.[2] Undercooked shellfish is a common source.[9] Humans are the only known host for the bacteria.[2] Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, insufficient clean drinking water, and poverty.[2] Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test,[2] or a rapid dipstick test, although the dipstick test is less accurate.[10]\\n\\nPrevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water.[5] Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months, and have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E. coli.[2] In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved a single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18–64 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission.[11] It offers limited protection to young children. People who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested.)[12]\\n\\nThe primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts (ORS), the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions.[2] Rice-based solutions are preferred.[2] In children, Zinc supplementation has also been found to improve outcomes.[6] In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer\\'s lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial.[2] The choice of antibiotic is aided by antibiotic sensitivity testing.[3]\\n\\nCholera continues to affect an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year.[2][7] To date, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the developing world, with the most recent beginning in 1961, and continuing today.[13] The illness is rare in high-income countries, and affects children most severely.[2][14] Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas.[2] Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia.[2] The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50% without such access to treatment.[2] Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit.[5] In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century.[15] The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water, and a map of the same was the first recorded incidence of epidemiological tracking.[5][16]\\n\\nVideo summary of this article with VideoWiki ( script\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nTypical cholera diarrhea that looks like \"rice water\"\\n\\nThe primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid.[17] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.[18] The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water\" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[17] An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5 US gal) of diarrhea a day.[17] Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.[17] If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.[17] Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.[19] Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\"[20] because a person\\'s skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.[21]\\n\\nFever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion. Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.[17]\\n\\nCause\\n\\nVibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera , the bacterium that causes cholera\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nCholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton.[17]\\n\\nTransmission is usually through the fecal-oral route of contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation.[2] Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water.[17] Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as Vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton.[22]\\n\\nPeople infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as \"rice-water\", contaminates water used by others.[23] A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of V. cholerae in the environment.[24] The source of the contamination is typically other people with cholera when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.[25][note 1]\\n\\nV. cholerae also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus.[26] Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of V. cholerae.[26] Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment.[26] This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of V. cholerae to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as \\'viable but non-culturable\\' (VBNC) or more conservatively \\'active but non-culturable\\' (ABNC).[26] One study indicates that the culturability of V. cholerae drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.[26][27]\\n\\nBoth toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a temperate bacteriophage.[28]\\n\\nSusceptibility\\n\\nAbout 100 million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.[17] This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors).[17] Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.[17] Individuals\\' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible.[17] Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to develop a severe case if they become infected.[29] Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can undergo a severe case, and each person\\'s case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.[medical citation needed]\\n\\nThe cystic fibrosis genetic mutation known as delta-F508 in humans has been said to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to V. cholerae infections.[30] In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.\\n\\nMechanism\\n\\nVibrio cholerae The role of biofilm in the intestinal colonization of\\n\\nWhen consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach.[31] The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they must propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.[31]\\n\\nOnce the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.[32]\\n\\nThe cholera toxin (CTX or CT) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6).[33] Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.\\n\\nMicrobiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.[34] Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless treated properly.[35]\\n\\nBy inserting separate, successive sections of V. cholerae DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as E. coli that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which V. cholerae responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of V. cholerae virulence determinants.[36] In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the V. cholerae bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.[34] Current[when?] research aims at discovering \"the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.\"[34]\\n\\nGenetic structure\\n\\nAmplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of V. cholerae has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.[37]\\n\\nAntibiotic resistance\\n\\nIn many areas of the world, antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin.[38] Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi-drug resistant cases.[39] New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in in vitro studies.[40]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nA rapid dipstick test is available to determine the presence of V. cholerae.[38] In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.[38] In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment via hydration and over-the-counter hydration solutions can be started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis, especially where cholera is a common problem.[41]\\n\\nStool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. If V. cholerae serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.[citation needed]\\n\\nInfection with V. cholerae O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by V. cholerae O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.[42]\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPreventive inoculation against cholera in 1966\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera.[35] They also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system.[35] Governments can play a role in all of these areas.\\n\\nWater, sanitation and hygiene\\n\\nAlthough cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to their nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices, cholera is rare. For example, the last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910–1911.[43][44] Cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) infrastructure is still inadequate.\\n\\nEffective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:[45]\\n\\nHandwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.[50]\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nA modelling approach using satellite data can enhance our ability to develop cholera risk maps in several regions of the globe.\\n\\nSurveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.[51] For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.[17]\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nEuvichol-plus oral vaccine for cholera\\n\\nSpanish physician Jaume Ferran i Clua developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease.[52] However, his vaccine and inoculation was rather controversial and was rejected by his peers and several investigation commissions.[53][54][55] Russian-Jewish bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine successfully developed the first human cholera vaccine in July 1892.[53][54][55][56] He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India.[55][57]\\n\\nPersons who survive an episode of cholera have long-lasting immunity for at least 3 years (the period tested.)[12] A number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available.[58] The World Health Organization (WHO) has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines (OCVs): Dukoral, Sanchol, and Euvichol. Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% during the first year after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects.[58] It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently[when?] recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries.[59] The vaccine that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends, Vaxchora, is an oral attenuated live vaccine, that is effective for adults aged 18–64 as a single dose.[60]\\n\\nOne injectable vaccine was found to be effective for two to three years. The protective efficacy was 28% lower in children less than five years old.[61] However, as of 2010 , it has limited availability.[2] Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination.[62] The WHO recommends immunization of high-risk groups, such as children and people with HIV, in countries where this disease is endemic.[2] If people are immunized broadly, herd immunity results, with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment.[38]\\n\\nWHO recommends that oral cholera vaccination be considered in areas where the disease is endemic (with seasonal peaks), as part of the response to outbreaks, or in a humanitarian crisis during which the risk of cholera is high.[63] Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) has been recognized as an adjunct tool for prevention and control of cholera. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccines—Dukoral (SBL Vaccines), containing a non-toxic B-subunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against V. cholerae O1; and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technology—ShanChol (Shantha Biotec) and Euvichol (EuBiologics Co.), which have bivalent O1 and O139 oral killed cholera vaccines.[64] Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera-endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists.[65]\\n\\nSari filtration\\n\\nWomen at a village pond in Matlab, Bangladesh washing utensils and vegetables. The woman on the right is putting a sari filter onto a water-collecting pot (or kalash ) to filter water for drinking.\\n\\nDeveloped for use in Bangladesh, the \"sari filter\" is a simple and cost-effective appropriate technology method for reducing the contamination of drinking water. Used sari cloth is preferable but other types of used cloth can be used with some effect, though the effectiveness will vary significantly. Used cloth is more effective than new cloth, as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibers. Water collected in this way has a greatly reduced pathogen count—though it will not necessarily be perfectly safe, it is an improvement for poor people with limited options.[66] In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half.[67] It involves folding a sari four to eight times.[66] Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it.[68] A nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.[67]\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nContinued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. The WHO recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause.[69] A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: \"Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.\"[70]\\n\\nFluids\\n\\nThe most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required.[71] In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer.[38] Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency.[38] In severe cases with significant dehydration, intravenous rehydration may be necessary. Ringer\\'s lactate is the preferred solution, often with added potassium.[17][69] Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed.[17] Ten percent of a person\\'s body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours.[17] This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success.[72] Despite widespread beliefs, fruit juices and commercial fizzy drinks like cola are not ideal for rehydration of people with serious infections of the intestines, and their excessive sugar content may even harm water uptake.[73]\\n\\nIf commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.[74]\\n\\nElectrolytes\\n\\nAs there frequently is initially acidosis, the potassium level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred.[17] As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced.[17] This may be done by consuming foods high in potassium, like bananas or coconut water.[75]\\n\\nAntibiotics\\n\\nAntibiotic treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms.[17] Use of antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements.[76] People will recover without them, however, if sufficient hydration is maintained.[38] The WHO only recommends antibiotics in those with severe dehydration.[75]\\n\\nDoxycycline is typically used first line, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance.[17] Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices.[17] Other antibiotics proven to be effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone.[77] Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.[78]\\n\\nAntibiotics improve outcomes in those who are both severely and not severely dehydrated.[79] Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.[79]\\n\\nZinc supplementation\\n\\nIn Bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and rehydration therapy as needed. It reduced the length of disease by eight hours and the amount of diarrhea stool by 10%.[80] Supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world.[80][81]\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\\nIf people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50–60%.[17][1]\\n\\nFor certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within two hours of becoming ill.[82]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nCholera affects an estimated 2.8 million people worldwide, and causes approximately 95,000 deaths a year (uncertainty range: 21,000–143,000) as of 2015 .[83][84] This occurs mainly in the developing world.[85]\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, death rates are believed to have still been higher than three million a year.[17] It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country.[38] As of 2004, cholera remained both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world.[17]\\n\\nRecent major outbreaks are the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and the 2016–2021 Yemen cholera outbreak. In October 2016, an outbreak of cholera began in war-ravaged Yemen.[86] WHO called it \"the worst cholera outbreak in the world\".[87] In 2019, 93% of the reported 923,037 cholera cases were from Yemen (with 1911 deaths reported).[88] Between September 2019 and September 2020, a global total of over 450,000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported; however, the accuracy of these numbers suffer from over-reporting from countries that report suspected cases (and not laboratory confirmed cases), as well as under-reporting from countries that do not report official cases (such as Bangladesh, India and Philippines).[88]\\n\\nAlthough much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, researchers still do not have a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir of infection, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease.\\n\\nCholera had disappeared from the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared toward the end of that century, beginning with a severe outbreak in Peru.[89] This was followed by the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak[90] and another outbreak of cholera in Haiti amid the 2018–2023 Haitian crisis.[91] As of August 2021 the disease is endemic in Africa and some areas of eastern and western Asia (Bangladesh, India and Yemen).[90] Cholera is not endemic in Europe; all reported cases had a travel history to endemic areas.[90]\\n\\nHistory of outbreaks\\n\\nDisposal of dead bodies during the cholera epidemic in Palermo in 1835\\n\\nThe word cholera is from Greek: χολέρα kholera from χολή kholē \"bile\". Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries.[17]\\n\\nReferences to cholera appear in the European literature as early as 1642, from the Dutch physician Jakob de Bondt\\'s description in his De Medicina Indorum.[92] (The \"Indorum\" of the title refers to the East Indies. He also gave first European descriptions of other diseases.) But at the time, the word \"cholera\" was historically used by European physicians to refer to any gastrointestinal upset resulting in yellow diarrhea. De Bondt thus used a common word already in regular use to describe the new disease. This was a frequent practice of the time. It was not until the 1830s that the name for severe yellow diarrhea changed in English from \"cholera\" to \"cholera morbus\" to differentiate it from what was then known as \"Asiatic cholera\", or that associated with origins in India and the East.\\n\\nEarly outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of crowded, poor living conditions, as well as the presence of pools of still water, both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive.[93] The disease first spread by travelers along trade routes (land and sea) to Russia in 1817, later to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world,[17] (hence the name \"Asiatic cholera\"[1]). Seven cholera pandemics have occurred since the early 19th century; the first one did not reach the Americas. The seventh pandemic originated in Indonesia in 1961.[94]\\n\\nThe first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India, near Calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa.[95] The movement of British Army and Navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic, since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the Indian Ocean, from Africa to Indonesia, and north to China and Japan.[96]\\n\\nThe second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected North America and Europe. Advancements in transportation and global trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers, meant that more people were carrying the disease more widely.[97]\\n\\nThe third pandemic erupted in 1846, persisted until 1860, extended to North Africa, and reached North and South America. It was introduced to North America at Quebec, Canada, via Irish immigrants from the Great Famine. In this pandemic, Brazil was affected for the first time.\\n\\nThe fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875, spreading from India to Naples and Spain, and reaching the United States at New Orleans, Louisiana in 1873. It spread throughout the Mississippi River system on the continent.\\n\\nThe fifth pandemic was from 1881 to 1896. It started in India and spread to Europe, Asia, and South America. The sixth pandemic ran from 1899 to 1923. These epidemics had a lower number of fatalities because physicians and researchers had a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics. Other areas, such as Germany in 1892 (primarily the city of Hamburg, where more than 8.600 people died)[98] and Naples from 1910 to 1911, also had severe outbreaks.\\n\\nThe seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists (as of 2018[99]) in developing countries.[100] This pandemic had initially subsided about 1975 and was thought to have ended, but, as noted, it has persisted. There were a rise in cases in the 1990s and since.\\n\\nCholera became widespread in the 19th century.[101] Since then it has killed tens of millions of people.[102] In Russia alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died from the disease.[103] It killed 150,000 Americans during the second pandemic.[104] Between 1900 and 1920, perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India.[105] Cholera officially became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health.[17] John Snow, in England, in 1854 was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its source of transmission.[17] Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but it still strongly affects populations in developing countries.\\n\\nIn the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers had cholera. No one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.[106]\\n\\nHistorically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore. Many of the older remedies were based on the miasma theory, that the disease was transmitted by bad air. Some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible, and flannel and cholera belts were included in army kits.[107] In the 1854–1855 outbreak in Naples, homeopathic camphor was used according to Hahnemann.[108] T. J. Ritter\\'s Mother\\'s Remedies book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern America. Elecampane was recommended in the United Kingdom, according to William Thomas Fernie.[109] The first effective human vaccine was developed in 1885, and the first effective antibiotic was developed in 1948.\\n\\nCholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments.[110] In the 19th century the United States, for example, had a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. It had three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, which can be attributed to Vibrio cholerae\\'s spread through interior waterways such as the Erie Canal and the extensive Mississippi River valley system, as well as the major ports along the Eastern Seaboard and their cities upriver.[111] The island of Manhattan in New York City touches the Atlantic Ocean, where cholera collected from river waters and ship discharges just off the coast. At this time, New York City did not have as effective a sanitation system as it developed in the later 20th century, so cholera spread through the city\\'s water supply.[112]\\n\\nCholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically to what is now defined as the disease of cholera.[15]\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nV. cholerae Robert Koch (third from the right) on a cholera research expedition in Egypt in 1884, one year after he identified\\n\\nHow to avoid the cholera leaflet; leaflet; Aberystwyth ; August 1849\\n\\nOne of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.[93] Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major \"state of the art\" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human sewage contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.[113] His model was not immediately accepted, but it was increasingly seen as plausible as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so. For his work on cholera, John Snow is often regarded as the \"Father of Epidemiology\".[114][115][116]\\n\\nThe bacterium was isolated in 1854 by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini,[117] but its exact nature and his results were not widely known. In the same year, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the bacterium.[118][119] In 1856 António Augusto da Costa Simões and José Ferreira de Macedo Pinto, two Portuguese researchers, are believed to have done the same.[118][120]\\n\\nBetween the mid-1850s and the 1900s, cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, Robert Koch identified V. cholerae with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.[121]\\n\\nHemendra Nath Chatterjee, a Bengali scientist, was the first to formulate and demonstrate the effectiveness of oral rehydration salt (ORS) to treat diarrhea. In his 1953 paper, published in The Lancet, he states that promethazine can stop vomiting during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible. The formulation of the fluid replacement solution was 4 g of sodium chloride, 25 g of glucose and 1000 ml of water.[122][123]\\n\\nIndian medical scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered the cholera toxin, the animal model of cholera, and successfully demonstrated the method of transmission of cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae.[124]\\n\\nRobert Allan Phillips, working at US Naval Medical Research Unit Two in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques. He developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the Lasker Foundation to award him its prize in 1967.[125]\\n\\nMore recently, in 2002, Alam, et al., studied stool samples from patients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of V. cholerae through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where genes that control biosynthesis of amino acids, iron uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the \"rice water\" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.[126]\\n\\nGlobal Strategy\\n\\nIn 2017, the WHO launched the \"Ending Cholera: a global roadmap to 2030\" strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030.[127] The strategy was developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) which develops country-specific plans and monitors progress.[128] The approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance, water sanitation, rehydration treatment and oral vaccines.[127] Specifically, the control strategy focuses on three approaches: i) early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks, ii) stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots, and iii) a global framework for cholera control through the GTFCC.[127]\\n\\nThe WHO and the GTFCC do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal.[129] Even though humans are the only host of cholera, the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host.[130] While global eradication is not possible, elimination of human to human transmission may be possible.[130] Local elimination is possible, which has been underway most recently during the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Haiti aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022.[131]\\n\\nThe GTFCC targets 47 countries, 13 of which have established vaccination campaigns.[88]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nHealth policy\\n\\nIn many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.[132] Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government\\'s role, according to a report from the James Baker Institute.[22] The Haitian government\\'s inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.[133]\\n\\nSimilarly, South Africa\\'s cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government\\'s policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.[134]\\n\\nAccording to Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute, if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government\\'s ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of Vibrio cholerae specimens.[22] Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government\\'s ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.[135] These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts.[135] Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government\\'s surveillance program. This inhibited physicians\\' abilities to detect cholera cases early.[136]\\n\\nAccording to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country\\'s health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak.[22] While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country\\'s poor.[137][138] The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.[139]\\n\\nBesides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera.[140] A country\\'s government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera\\'s spread. This limits cholera\\'s ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.[140] Inversely, poor government response can lead to civil unrest and cholera riots.[141]\\n\\nNotable cases\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n\\nUnlike tuberculosis (\"consumption\") which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament,[152] cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the poor living in unsanitary conditions. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease – which includes voluminous \"rice-water\" diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death – has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even being factually presented in popular culture.[153]\\n\\nCountry examples\\n\\nZambia\\n\\nIn Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, most commonly in the capital city of Lusaka.[154] In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. There was a rapid increase in the number of cases from several hundred cases in early December 2017 to approximately 2,000 by early January 2018.[155] With intensification of the rains, new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported.[156]\\n\\nIn collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples.[155]\\n\\nThe Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December.[157]\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nThe city of Kolkata, India in the state of West Bengal in the Ganges delta has been described as the \"homeland of cholera\", with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality. In India, where the disease is endemic, cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons. India is also characterized by high population density, unsafe drinking water, open drains, and poor sanitation which provide an optimal niche for survival, sustenance and transmission of Vibrio cholerae.[158]\\n\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\\n\\nIn Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history. Cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology, basic membrane biology, and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design.[159]\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n^ According to CDC ,\"The infection [cholera] is not likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk factor for becoming ill.\"\\n\\nReferences'"

PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response.[85] Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a thermostat.[7] When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. Norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate.[86]\n",

EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata (rRPa), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs.[citation needed]\n",

Schmitt, is that \"as parents we tend to suspect that our children's brains may melt.\"[123] As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child's sleep to give the child more medicine.[122]\n",

known as your body\\'s \"thermostat\" — monitors this balance.', \"Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day.\", 'It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.', 'When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher.', 'This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss.', 'The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat.', 'When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.', 'Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.', 'Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:\\n\\nA viral infection\\n\\nA bacterial infection\\n\\nHeat exhaustion\\n\\nCertain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis — inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)\\n\\nA cancerous (malignant) tumor\\n\\nSome medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures\\n\\nSome immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine\\n\\nComplications\\n\\nChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure).', 'About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.', 'A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness.', 'Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.', \"If a seizure occurs:\\n\\nLay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground\\n\\nRemove any sharp objects that are near your child\\n\\nLoosen tight clothing\\n\\nHold your child to prevent injury\\n\\nDon't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure\\n\\nCall 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure\\n\\nGet emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.\", \"If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.\", 'Prevention\\n\\nYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases.', 'Here are some tips that can help:']\n"

            "CausesTypical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) — also known as your body's \"thermostat\" — monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.\n",
            "When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.\n",
            "Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.\n",

            "A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.\n",
