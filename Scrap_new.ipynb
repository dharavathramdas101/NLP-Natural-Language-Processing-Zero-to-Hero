            "Wash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\n",
            "Clean and disinfect. Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.\n",

            "For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.\n",
            "Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies\n",

            "SymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.\n",
            "Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:\n",

            "Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.\n",
            "Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.\n",
            "In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.\n",
            "When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm — or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.\n",
            "Infants and toddlers\n",
            "A fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:\n",

            "Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.\n",
            "Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.\n",

            "Children\n",
            "There's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.\n",
            "Call your child's health care provider if your child:\n",
            "\n",
            "Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.\n",
            "Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.\n",

            "Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.\n",

            "CausesTypical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) — also known as your body's \"thermostat\" — monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.\n",
            "When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.\n",
            "Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.\n",

            "\n",
            "ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.\n",
            "A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.\n",

            "Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.\n",
            "Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.\n",
            "Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.\n",
            "Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.\n",
            "Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.\n",
            "Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.\n",

temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss an area in the brain called the hypothalamus hipoethaluhmuhs  also known as your bodys thermostat  monitors this balance even when youre healthy your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day it can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening\\nwhen your immune system responds to disease the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher this prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss the shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat when you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled you are helping your body retain heat\\nfevers below 104 f 40 c associated with common viral infections such as the flu may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful\\nfever or elevated body temperature might be caused by\\n\\na viral infection\\na bacterial infection\\nheat exhaustion\\ncertain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints synovium\\na cancerous malignant tumor\\nsome medications such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures\\nsome immunizations such as the diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis dtap pneumococcal or covid vaccine\\n\\ncomplicationschildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at

departments Print OverviewA fever is a temporary rise in body temperature Its one part of an overall response from the bodys immune system A fever is usually caused by an infection For most children and adults a fever may be uncomfortable But it usually isnt a cause for concern For infants however even a low fever may mean theres a serious infection Fevers generally go away within a few days A number of overthecounter medications lower a fever But you dont necessarily need to treat a fever if its not causing discomfortProducts ServicesBook Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies SymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 986 F 37 C A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer oral temperature thats 100 F 378 C or higher is generally considered to be a fever Depending on whats causing a fever other fever signs and symptoms may include Sweating Chills and shivering Headache Muscle aches Loss of appetite Irritability Dehydration General weakness Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature you can choose from several types of thermometers including oral rectal ear tympanic and forehead temporal artery thermometers Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature Ear or forehead thermometers although convenient provide less accurate temperature measurements In infants a rectal temperature if doable is somewhat more accurate When reporting a temperature to your health care provider give both the reading and the type of thermometer used When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm or a reason to call a doctor Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby your child or yourself Infants and toddlers A fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers Call your babys health care provider if your child is Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 1004 F 38 C or higher Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F 389 C or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable sluggish or uncomfortable Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F 389 C that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms If your child also has other signs and symptoms such as a runny nose cough or diarrhea you can call sooner Children Theres probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing Call your childs health care provider if your child Is listless confused or has poor eye contact with you Is irritable vomits repeatedly has a severe headache sore throat stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort Has a fever after being left in a hot car Seek medical care immediately Has a fever that lasts longer than three days Has a seizure associated with the fever Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesnt recover quickly Ask your childs health care provider for guidance in special circumstances such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness Adults Call your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F 394 C or higher Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever Severe headache Rash Unusual sensitivity to bright light Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward Mental confusion strange behavior or altered speech Persistent vomiting Difficulty breathing or chest pain Abdominal pain Pain when urinating Convulsions or seizures

heat production and heat loss An area in the brain called the hypothalamus hipoeTHALuhmuhs also known as your bodys thermostat monitors this balance Even when youre healthy your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening When your immune system responds to disease the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled you are helping your body retain heat Fevers below 104 F 40 C associated with common viral infections such as the flu may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by A viral infection A bacterial infection Heat exhaustion Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis inflammation of the lining of your joints synovium A cancerous malignant tumor Some medications such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures Some immunizations such as the diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis DTaP pneumococcal or COVID vaccine ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever febrile seizure About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one most commonly within the next 12 months A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness shaking of limbs on both sides of the body eyes rolling back or body stiffness Although alarming for parents the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects If a seizure occurs Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground Remove any sharp objects that are near your child Loosen tight clothing Hold your child to prevent injury Dont place anything in your childs mouth or try to stop the seizure Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesnt appear to recover well after the seizure Get emergency room or urgent care services if its your childs first febrile seizure If your child doesnt need emergency care see your childs health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases Here are some tips that can help Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases such as influenza and COVID19 Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same especially before eating after using the toilet after spending time in a crowd or around someone whos sick after petting animals and during travel on public transportation Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you dont have access to soap and water Try to avoid touching your nose mouth or eyes as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze and teach your children to do the same Whenever possible turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them Avoid sharing cups water bottles and utensils with your child or children By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment

treatmentdoctors departments print overviewa fever is a temporary rise in body temperature its one part of an overall response from the bodys immune system a fever is usually caused by an infection for most children and adults a fever may be uncomfortable but it usually isnt a cause for concern for infants however even a low fever may mean theres a serious infection fevers generally go away within a few days a number of overthecounter medications lower a fever but you dont necessarily need to treat a fever if its not causing discomfortproducts servicesbook mayo clinic book of home remedies symptomsbody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day the average temperature has traditionally been defined as 986 f 37 c a temperature taken using a mouth thermometer oral temperature thats 100 f 378 c or higher is generally considered to be a fever depending on whats causing a fever other fever signs and symptoms may include sweating chills and shivering headache muscle aches loss of appetite irritability dehydration general weakness taking a temperatureto take a temperature you can choose from several types of thermometers including oral rectal ear tympanic and forehead temporal artery thermometers oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature ear or forehead thermometers although convenient provide less accurate temperature measurements in infants a rectal temperature if doable is somewhat more accurate when reporting a temperature to your health care provider give both the reading and the type of thermometer used when to see a doctorfevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm or a reason to call a doctor yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby your child or yourself infants and toddlers a fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers call your babys health care provider if your child is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 1004 f 38 c or higher between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 f 389 c or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable sluggish or uncomfortable between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 f 389 c that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms if your child also has other signs and symptoms such as a runny nose cough or diarrhea you can call sooner children theres probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive this means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice your child may also be drinking fluids and playing call your childs health care provider if your child is listless confused or has poor eye contact with you is irritable vomits repeatedly has a severe headache sore throat stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort has a fever after being

balance of heat production and heat loss an area in the brain called the hypothalamus hipoethaluhmuhs also known as your bodys thermostat monitors this balance even when youre healthy your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day it can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening when your immune system responds to disease the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher this prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss the shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat when you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled you are helping your body retain heat fevers below 104 f 40 c associated with common viral infections such as the flu may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by a viral infection a bacterial infection heat exhaustion certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis inflammation of the lining of your joints synovium a cancerous malignant tumor some medications such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures some immunizations such as the diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis dtap pneumococcal or covid vaccine complicationschildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever febrile seizure about a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one most commonly within the next 12 months a febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness shaking of limbs on both sides of the body eyes rolling back or body stiffness although alarming for parents the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects if a seizure occurs lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground remove any sharp objects that are near your child loosen tight clothing hold your child to prevent injury dont place anything in your childs mouth or try to stop the seizure call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesnt appear to recover well after the seizure get emergency room or urgent care services if its your childs first febrile seizure if your child doesnt need emergency care see your childs health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation preventionyou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases here are some tips that can help get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases such as influenza and covid19 follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same especially before eating after using the toilet after spending time in a crowd or around someone whos sick after petting animals and during travel on public transportation show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you dont have access to soap and water try to avoid touching your nose mouth or eyes as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze and teach your children to do the same whenever possible turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them avoid sharing cups water bottles and utensils with your child or children by mayo clinic staff request an appointment

from the bodys immune system A fever is usually caused by an infection\\nFor most children and adults a fever may be uncomfortable But it usually isnt a cause for concern For infants however even a low fever may mean theres a serious infection\\nFevers generally go away within a few days A number of overthecounter medications lower a fever But you dont necessarily need to treat a fever if its not causing discomfortProducts  ServicesBook Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 986 F 37 C A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer oral temperature thats 100 F 378 C or higher is generally considered to be a fever\\nDepending on

weakness\\n\\nTaking a temperatureTo take a temperature you can choose from several types of thermometers including oral rectal ear tympanic and forehead temporal artery thermometers\\nOral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature Ear or forehead thermometers although convenient provide less accurate temperature measurements\\nIn infants a rectal temperature if doable is somewhat more accurate When reporting a temperature to your health care provider give both the reading and the type of thermometer used\\nWhen to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby your child or yourself\\nInfants and toddlers\\nA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers Call your babys health care provider if your child is\\n\\nYounger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 1004 F 38 C or higher\\nBetween 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F 389 C or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable sluggish or uncomfortable\\nBetween 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F 389 C that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms If your child also has other signs and symptoms such as a runny nose cough or diarrhea you can call sooner\\n\\nChildren\\nTheres probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing\\nCall your childs health care provider if your child\\n\\nIs listless confused or has poor eye contact with you\\nIs irritable vomits repeatedly has a severe headache sore throat stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort\\nHas a fever after being left in a hot car Seek medical care immediately\\nHas a fever that lasts longer than three days\\nHas a seizure associated with the fever Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesnt recover quickly\\n\\nAsk your childs health care provider for guidance in special circumstances such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness\\nAdults\\nCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F 394 C or higher Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever\\n\\nSevere headache\\nRash\\nUnusual sensitivity to bright light\\nStiff neck and pain

temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss An area in the brain called the hypothalamus hipoeTHALuhmuhs  also known as your bodys thermostat  monitors this balance Even when youre healthy your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening\\nWhen your immune system responds to disease the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled you are helping your body retain heat\\nFevers below 104 F 40 C associated with common viral infections such as the flu may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful\\nFever or elevated body temperature might be caused by\\n\\nA viral infection\\nA bacterial infection\\nHeat exhaustion\\nCertain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints synovium\\nA cancerous malignant tumor\\nSome medications such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures\\nSome immunizations such as the diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis DTaP pneumococcal or COVID vaccine\\n\\nComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever febrile seizure About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one most commonly within the next 12 months\\nA febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness shaking of limbs on both sides of the body eyes rolling back or body stiffness Although alarming for parents the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects\\nIf a seizure occurs\\n\\nLay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground\\nRemove any sharp objects that are near your child\\nLoosen tight clothing\\nHold your child to prevent injury\\nDont place anything in your childs mouth or try to stop the seizure\\nCall 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesnt appear to recover well after the seizure\\nGet emergency room or urgent care services if its your childs first febrile seizure\\n\\nIf your child doesnt need emergency care see your childs health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation\\nPreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases Here are some tips that can help\\n\\nGet vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases such as influenza and COVID19\\nFollow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing\\nWash your hands often and teach your children to do the same especially before eating after using the toilet after spending time in a crowd or around someone whos sick after petting animals and during travel on public transportation\\nShow your children how to wash their hands thoroughly covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water\\nCarry hand sanitizer with you for times when you dont have access to soap and water\\nTry to avoid touching your nose mouth or eyes as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection\\nCover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze and teach your children to do the same Whenever possible turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them\\nAvoid sharing cups water bottles and utensils with your child or children\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\nDiagnosis  treatment\\n\\r\\n    May 07

              "' obesity  overviewobesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat obesity isnt just a cosmetic concern its a medical problem that increases the risk of other diseases and health problems such as heart disease diabetes high blood pressure and certain cancers there are many reasons why some people have difficulty losing weight usually obesity results from inherited physiological and environmental factors combined with diet physical activity and exercise choices the good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity a healthier diet increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight prescription medications and weightloss procedures are additional options for treating obesityproducts servicesbook the mayo clinic diet bundlethe mayo clinic diet experienceshow more products from mayo clinic symptomsbody mass index bmi is often used to diagnose obesity to calculate bmi multiply weight in pounds by 703 divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared bmi weight status below 185 underweight 185249 normal 250299 overweight 300 and higher obesity asians with bmi of 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems for most people bmi provides a reasonable estimate of body fat however bmi doesnt directly measure body fat so some people such as muscular athletes may have a bmi in the obesity category even though they dont have excess body fat many doctors also measure a persons waist circumference to help guide treatment decisions weightrelated health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches 102 centimeters and in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches 89 centimeters when to see a doctorif youre concerned about your weight or weightrelated health problems ask your doctor about obesity management you and your doctor can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weightloss optionsmore informationobesity care at mayo clinicwhat is insulin resistance a mayo clinic expert explains  causesalthough there are genetic behavioral metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through normal daily activities and exercise your body stores these excess calories as fat in the united states most peoples diets are too high in calories often from fast food and highcalorie beverages people with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full feel hungry sooner or eat more due to stress or anxiety many people who live in western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding so they dont tend to burn as many calories at work even daily activities use fewer calories courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls escalators online shopping and drivethrough banks risk factorsobesity usually results from a combination of causes and contributing factors family inheritance and influencesthe genes you inherit from your parents may affect the amount of body fat you store and where that fat is distributed genetics may also play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy how your body regulates your appetite and how your body burns calories during exercise obesity tends to run in families thats not just because of the genes they share family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits lifestyle choices unhealthy diet a diet thats high in calories lacking in fruits and vegetables full of fast food and laden with highcalorie beverages and oversized portions contributes to weight gain liquid calories people can drink many calories without feeling full especially calories from alcohol other highcalorie beverages such as sugared soft drinks can contribute to significant weight gain inactivity if you have a sedentary lifestyle you can easily take in more calories every day than you burn through exercise and routine daily activities looking at computer tablet and phone screens is a sedentary activity the number of hours spent in front of a screen is highly associated with weight gain certain diseases and medicationsin some people obesity can be traced to a medical cause such as praderwilli syndrome cushing syndrome and other conditions medical problems such as arthritis also can lead to decreased activity which may result in weight gain some medications can lead to weight gain if you dont compensate through diet or activity these medications include some antidepressants antiseizure medications diabetes medications antipsychotic medications steroids and beta blockers social and economic issuessocial and economic factors are linked to obesity avoiding obesity is difficult if you dont have safe areas to walk or exercise similarly you may not have been taught healthy ways of cooking or you may not have access to healthier foods in addition the people you spend time with may influence your weight youre more likely to develop obesity if you have friends or relatives with obesity ageobesity can occur at any age even in young children but as you age hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity in addition the amount of muscle in your body tends to decrease with age generally lower muscle mass leads to a decrease in metabolism these changes also reduce calorie needs and can make it harder to keep off excess weight if you dont consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age youll likely gain weight other factors pregnancy weight gain is common during pregnancy some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born this weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women quitting smoking quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain and for some it can lead to enough weight gain to qualify as obesity often this happens as people use food to cope with smoking withdrawal in the long run however quitting smoking is still a greater benefit to your health than is continuing to smoke your doctor can help you prevent weight gain after quitting smoking lack of sleep not getting enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that increase appetite you may also crave foods high in calories and carbohydrates which can contribute to weight gain stress many external factors that affect mood and wellbeing may contribute to obesity people often seek more highcalorie food when experiencing stressful situations microbiome your gut bacteria are affected by what you eat and may contribute to weight gain or difficulty losing weight even if you have one or more of these risk factors it doesnt mean that youre destined to develop obesity you can counteract most risk factors through diet physical activity and exercise and behavior changes complicationspeople with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems including heart disease and strokes obesity makes you more likely to have high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels
